        <li><u>TPS</u>: 
            In 2021, Biden granted TPS to Venezuelans, citing high levels of crime in Venezuela due to instbaility from Maduro.
            On Mar 31, 2025, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco paused a DHS decision to remove temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezualans.
            600,000 Venezualans in the US have TPS, the ruling protects 348,000 of them.
            In the ruling, Chen said "Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes."
            Venezuelan TPS holders are more likely to hold bachelor's degrees than U.S. citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general U.S. population.

            On April 18, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to pause Chen's TRO while they considered the case, due to the Trump admin not showing it would suffer irreparable harm from the TRO.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/court-rejects-trump-bid-end-venezuelan-migrants-legal-status-2025-04-18/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            On May 19, the Supreme Court paused Chen's TRO while the appeals court considers the case (Jackson was the only one to publicly dissent), allowing Trump to move ahead with ending TPS for Venezuelans.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-lets-trump-end-deportation-protection-venezuelans-2025-05-19/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
            On June 24, Noem said the 521,000 Haitians granted TPS under Biden will have their status terminated on September 2 (original date she set in February was for Aug 2).
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-end-deportation-relief-haitian-migrants-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
            On July 1, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn blocked Noem's Hatian TPS revokation, saying "Secretary Noem does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation," making her actions "unlawful."
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-ending-temporary-protected-status-haitians-2025-07-01/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>

        <li><u>Wrongful Deportations</u>:
          <ul>
            <li><u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u>: 
              In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
              In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
              The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-judge-hear-lawsuit-man-deported-el-salvador-error-2025-04-04/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
              On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-sidelines-doj-lawyer-after-judge-orders-return-man-deported-erroneously-2025-04-06/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
              On April 7, ahead of the deadline, Chief Justice Roberts issued a stay on Xinis' order while they considered the case, after an appeals court refused to pause the TRO for Trump. 
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-facing-monday-deadline-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man-el-salvador-2025-04-07/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
              On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
              In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful.
              <sup>
                  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-supreme-court-upholds-order-facilitate-return-deportee-sent-el-salvador-error-2025-04-10/" target="_blank">[4]</a>

              </sup>
              On April 11, Xinis ordered Trump to give daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia, saying the Trump admin has "done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia." 
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-orders-trump-administration-advise-its-steps-return-wrongly-deported-2025-04-11/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
              In the coming days, the Trump admin said Abrego was "alive and secure" but that SC's order to "facilitate" the return of him meant they should only "remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here."
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-state-department-says-deported-maryland-resident-alive-secure-el-salvador-2025-04-13/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
              On April 14, 2025, Trump met with El Salvador president Bukele, during the visit, Bukele said he would not return Abrego Garcia and Trump said he would not ask for him back, with both justifying saying Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.
              During the meeting, Pam Bondi said that "facilitate" meant they would just provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia to the US, she also claimed Kilmar had been given a deportation order twice, when he had never been given one.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-says-it-is-not-required-help-wrongly-deported-man-return-us-2025-04-14/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>
              Bukele said he would not return Kilmar since that would be like smuggling a terrorist to the US.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-meet-with-el-salvadors-president-amid-questions-over-deportations-2025-04-14/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
              On April 15, 2025, Xinis ordered DHS and ICE officials to testify under oath about what they were doing to get Abrego Garcia back.
              In the order Xinis said "To date, what the record shows is that nothing has been done (to get Abrego Garcia back). Nothing." 
              She stopped short of ordering Trump to ask El Salvador outright to return Abrego Garcia but said their refusal to do so was "stunning."
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-consider-trumps-compliance-with-order-over-wrongly-deported-man-2025-04-15/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
              On April 16, 2025, Dem Senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador in an attempt to talk to Abrego Garcia but was denied access by the El Salvador's Vice President Felix Ulloa, who also said they were not releasing Abrego Garcia because the US paying to keep him incarcerated.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senator-lands-el-salvador-seeking-release-wrongly-deported-salvadoran-man-2025-04-16/" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>
              In a reversal, on April 17, 2025, Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia at a hotel, confirming he was healthy, Abrego Garcia also said he had been moved from CECOT to a better detention facility 8 days before the meeting.
              <sup>

              </sup>
              Also on April 17, 2025, an appeals court rejected Trumps bid to halt Xinis' TRO and also rejected his bid to prevent Xinis from probing if the Trump admin was in contempt for not returning Kilmar.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/probe-trump-teams-compliance-with-order-deported-man-can-proceed-court-rules-2025-04-17/" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup>
              On April 21, 2025, U.S. House Rep Maxwell Frost of Florida, Robert Garcia of California, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon travelled to El Salvador to try and facilitate Abrego Garcia's return but were denied access to Abrego Garcia by the Salvadorian government.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congress-members-visit-el-salvador-facilitate-release-deported-man-2025-04-21/" target="_blank">[14]</a></sup>
              On May 26, 2025, US Rep from Maryland, Glenn Ivey, was denied access to CECOT after travelling to El Salvador to meet Abrego Garcia, despite having made a formal request with the Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S. ahead of the visit.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maryland-congressman-denied-access-see-man-wrongly-deported-el-salvador-2025-05-27/" target="_blank">[15]</a></sup>
              On June 6, 2025, Abrego Garcia was flown back to the US to face criminal charges of transporting illegal immigrants, firearms, and drugs.
              Following the indictment, 15-year veteran of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Nashville, Ben Schrader, resigned in protest.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/abrego-garcia-way-us-face-criminal-charges-abc-news-reports-2025-06-06/" target="_blank">[17]</a></sup>
              On June 22, 2025, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville ordered Abrego be released on bail pending his trial.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/abrego-garcia-ordered-released-pending-trial-migrant-smuggling-charges-2025-06-23/" target="_blank">[18]</a></sup>
              A few days later Holmes ordered the pre-trial release of Abrego (non-bail release) and restricted Trump  from deporting him while the case played out.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/returned-deportee-abrego-due-us-court-over-bail-conditions-2025-06-25/" target="_blank">[19]</a></sup>
              On July 2, Abrego said he was "subjected to severe mistreatment upon arrival at CECOT, including but not limited to severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture" and that he lost 31 pounds in his first two weeks at CECOT.
