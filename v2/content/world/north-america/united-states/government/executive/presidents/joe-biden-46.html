            On August 21, 2025, a New York state appeals court threw out the half-billion-dollar penalty while preserving a fraud case against Trump, enabling him to rebound from one of his biggest legal defeats.
            The court ruled 4-1 to let the fraud finding stand, but all found problems in the judge's handling of the case and two would have ordered a new trial.
            A fifth judge would have dismissed the case altogether, and all five judges would have voided the payout.
            Justice Peter Moulton and chief judge Dianne Renwick agreed Trump "engaged in a decade-long pattern of financial fraud and illegality" but also said Trump's wrongdoing did not cause "cataclysmic harm" to justify a half-billion-dollar award.
            Two other judges, John Higgitt and Llinet Rosado, agreed James had authority to sue, but a new trial was necessary because Engoron was too quick to find fraud.
            Justice David Friedman, the only judge on the panel appointed by a Republican governor, said James' case was politically motivated, and voters had rendered their own verdict on Trump's political career.
