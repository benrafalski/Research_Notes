          On September 8, 2025, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan rejected Trump's appeal of the $83.3 million verdict, dismissing his argument that the January 2024 verdict should be overturned because he deserved presidential immunity from Carroll's lawsuit.

        <li><u>Trump NY Fraud Case</u>
            In 2019, New York Attorney General Letitia James opened a probe into Donald Trump for civil fraud.
            On September 21, 2022, James sues Trump, his three adult children, the Trump Organization, former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg and others, saying Trump oversaw a "staggering fraud" for more than a decade by inflating his net worth.
            Trump calls the lawsuit by James, who is Black, "Another Witch Hunt by a racist Attorney General."
            On September 14, 2023 Trump sues the judge presiding over the case (Justice Arthur Engoron of the Manhattan Supreme Court), seeking to halt the trial until he decides whether to dismiss most of James' claims and a state appeals court judge grants a temporary pause, pending that court's review of the case.
            On September 26, Engoron found the defendants liable for fraud in a summary judgement, saying their asset valuations reflected a "fantasy world," and finding "conclusive evidence" that Trump inflated his net worth by as much as $2.2 billion but he left damages and other claims for the trial.
            Engoron said the made up valuations included valuing the Trump Tower apartment as if it were three times its actual size and worth $327 million, and estimating that Mar-a-Lago was worth up to $739 million though its assessed value was no more than $28 million.
            On September 28, the state appeals court lifts its temporary pause on a trial, clearing the way for it to begin.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-york-attorney-generals-fraud-case-against-donald-trump-2023-10-02/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            On October 2, the non-jury trial started, with James is seeking at least $250 million in fines, a permanent ban against Trump and his sons Donald Jr and Eric from running businesses in New York and a five-year commercial real estate ban against Trump and the Trump Organization.
            James accused Trump of materially overvaluing assets including his Trump Tower penthouse apartment in Manhattan, his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and various office towers and golf clubs, and inflated his own fortune by as much as $2.2 billion.
            The trial concluded on December 13.

            </sup>
            On February 16, 2024, Engoron ruled that Trump must pay $354.9 million in penalties in the fraud case.
            Engoron also banned Trump from serving as an officer or director of any New York corporation for three years and barred Trump and his companies named in the suit from applying for loans from any financial institution chartered in New York for three years.
            Trump and the other defendants in the case, Engoron wrote in the ruling, "are incapable of admitting the error of their ways."
            Engoron said Trump and his companies' past run-ins with the law were also part of the reason for the stiff penalties (Trump Organization was found guilty of criminal tax fraud in 2022 and two other Trump entities previously settled allegations of wrongdoing brought by New York state).
            Don Jr. and Eric were ordered to pay $4 million apiece and former Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg was ordered to pay $1 million and barred for life from managing any New York company's finances.
            On February 23, Trump was formally ordered by a New York judge to pay $454.2 million ($354 million plus interest).
            On February 28, Associate Justice Anil Singh of the New York Appellate Division rejected Trump's bid to pause the $454.2 million civil fraud judgment but granted Trump's request for a stay on Engoron's decision barring Trump from running any New York corporation or seeking loans from the state's banks for three years.
            Singh's ruling must be affirmed by a full panel of the mid-level state appeals court.
            In April, Trump averted possible asset seizures in the case by posting a $175 million bond while he appeals.

            </sup>
            On August 21, 2025, a New York state appeals court threw out the half-billion-dollar penalty while preserving a fraud case against Trump, enabling him to rebound from one of his biggest legal defeats.
            The court ruled 4-1 to let the fraud finding stand, but all found problems in the judge's handling of the case and two would have ordered a new trial.
            A fifth judge would have dismissed the case altogether, and all five judges would have voided the payout.
            Justice Peter Moulton and chief judge Dianne Renwick agreed Trump "engaged in a decade-long pattern of financial fraud and illegality" but also said Trump's wrongdoing did not cause "cataclysmic harm" to justify a half-billion-dollar award.
            Two other judges, John Higgitt and Llinet Rosado, agreed James had authority to sue, but a new trial was necessary because Engoron was too quick to find fraud.
            Justice David Friedman, the only judge on the panel appointed by a Republican governor, said James' case was politically motivated, and voters had rendered their own verdict on Trump's political career.

        <li><u>Stormy Daniels Case</u>
          November 6, 2025: 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said a federal district judge should have more closely reviewed whether the presidential immunity decision meant some evidence at Trump's criminal trial should have been excluded.

          November 14: Peter Skandalakis, director of the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council of Georgia, appoints himself as the prosecutor in the case, replacing Fani Willis.
          Skandalakis said he appointed himself after being unable to find another prosecutor willing to take over the case.

          November 26: Skandalakis dropped all criminal charges in Georgia against Trump, saying "there is no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial," so it would be "futile and unproductive" to push forward with the case.

        <li><u>Alex Jones Ruling</u>
          In 2022, a judge and jury found Alex Jones guilty of making false statements about Sandy Hook and issued a $1.4 billion judgment to pay to 14 family members of the shooting victims.
          Jones was sued for defamation after calling the shooting a "false flag" operation meant to stir up anti-gun sentiment among Americans, and he has said that the parents of slain children were "crisis actors" who were faking their grief in television interviews.
          It is believed to be the largest judgment in American libel case history.
          He also lost a similar lawsuit in Texas with a roughly $50 million judgment and he declared bankruptcy after losing the lawsuits.
          In October 2025, the Supreme Court rejected Jones' bid to have the ruling overturned.

          June 28, 2023: Taylor Taranto, a Navy Veteran and January 6 rioter, livesteamed himself making fake bomb hoax threats saying he was going to blow up the NIST building in D.C. (building tied to government conspiracies).

          June 29: Taranto reposted a Trump Truth post that had Obama's address, then drove his weapons-filled van (2 guns) to the Obama's neighborhood.
          He then livestreamed himself hunting "entrance points to underground tunnels," saying "Gotta get the shot, stop at nothing," "We got 'em surrounded," and "They hang for treason." 
          Taranto was referring to the QAnon belief that underground "tunnels" link the homes of prominent Democrats like Obama and John Podesta.

        <li><u>Brian Thompson Assassination</u>
          On September 16, Justice Gregory Carro dismissed the two terrorism-related charges against Mangione.
          He ruled that prosecutors had not presented enough evidence that Mangione acted with the intent to intimidate health insurance workers or influence government policy, which is required to prove murder as an act of terrorism.  
          A small group of Mangione supporters gathered outside the courthouse during the proceedings, with one dressed in a green costume of the Nintendo character Luigi, and another held the red, white and green Italian tricolor with the words "Healthcare is a human right" inscribed on the flag.
          About two dozen members of the public - mostly young women - secured seats in the back of the courtroom to watch the proceedings, one wearing a t-shirt that said "Free Luigi".
