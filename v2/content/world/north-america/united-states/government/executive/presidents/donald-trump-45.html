      <h3>2020 Election Aftermath</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Michigan Electors Case</u>
            On September 9, 2025, District Court Judge Kristen D. Simmons dismissed criminal charges against a group of 15 residents charged with illegally attempting to certify the election for Trump.
            The judge said that the 15 defendants were legally exercising their constitutional rights when they attempted to present themselves as the state's proper electors following the November 2020 election.
            Simmons also said prosecutors had failed to prove intent to defraud the state since defendants "sincerely believed, for some reason, that there were some serious irregularities with the election or with the voting."

                Many of the Proud Boys didn't attend Trump's speech at the Ellipse, instead they gathered at the Washington Monument to head to the Capitol early.
                About 200-300 Proud Boys were in the group that marched from the Washington Monument to the Capitol.
                While marching they <a href="https://youtu.be/jWJVMoe7OY0?t=435" target="_blank">said</a> things like "where's Antifa?" and "Let's take this f***ing Capitol!"
                The Proud Boys leader, Enrique Tarrio, wasn't at the event so the group marched to the Capitol being led by seniro member Ethan Nordean ("Rufio Panman").
                The Proud Boys normally dressed in tactical gear and yellow and black colors, but on January 6th they dressed "<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/page/file/1357251/dl?inline=" target="_blank">incognito</a>".

                In another message posted after January 6th, Sparks warned, "A new dawn is coming. Be ready. Just pray and trust in the Lord."
                He claimed he was canceling his Facebook account and had "give[n] up on democracy."
                He warned readers to "be ready for a lot of big events. Have radios for power loss etc. Love every body[.]"
