        <li><u>Young DOGE Techies</u>: 
            After the creation of DOGE, Musk relied on about a dozen young tech engineers with little government experience to takeover the agency.
            These engineers include Gavin Klinger, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine.  
            Gavin Klinger is a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Major grad from Berkeley in 2020, he was previously a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks, he also has a substack where he wrote an article "the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies"; Klinger was later found to have retweeted post from Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate in the past.  
            Luke Forritor is a former intern at SpaceX, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for rocket fuel parts, he graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a CS major, he was previously part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll.
            Edward Coristine is only a highschool grad having been enrolled at Northeastern University, he previously spent 3 weeks at Musk's Neuralink last summer, he also previously created 3 tech firms in Connecticut that are valued at $2.4 million by Zillow; it was later disclosed that Coristine had been fired from his previous job at Path Network amid a leaking investigation.

            In Feb 2025, one of engineers, Marko Elez, resigned from DOGE after he was linked to a deleted social-media account that advocated racism and eugenics.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/staffer-with-elon-musks-doge-amplified-white-supremacists-online-2025-02-07/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            In Mar 2025, it was revealed that Coristine (also called "bigballs"), had ran a network company called DiamondCDN that provided services to cybercriminal group "EGodly,"
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-staffer-big-balls-provided-tech-support-cybercrime-ring-records-show-2025-03-26/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
            In April 2025, it was revealed that Christopher Stanley, a former engineer for X and SpaceX, and became a senior advisor in the Deputy Attorney General's office, had previously ran sites that distributed pirated ebooks, bootleg software and video game cheats.
            After Stanely's past was reported by Reuters, his old sites were scrubbed from the Internet Archive, despite DOGE claiming they are for "radical transparency."

            In June 2025, Coristine ("Big Balls") resigned from DOGE.

        <li><u>Indirect research costs</u>:
          On June 20, 2025, District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston invalidated an NSF policy from May that limited universities to be reimbursed for "indirect costs" of research to just 15% of direct funding, ruling that it was "arbitrary and capricious."

      <ul>
        <li><u>Autism</u>: 
            RFK Jr has claimed that autism is an "epidemic" and that we know that it is caused by "environmental exposure."
            <sup><a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
            Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
            In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
            No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
            Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
            Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
            Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/why-are-autism-rates-rising-2025-01-14/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            Despite Kennedy saying they would go after autism, during the first 4 months of 2025, has reduced funding for autism-related research by an estimated $31 million to $116 million from $147 million in the same period in 2024.
            The funding cuts came because they involved diverse populations, studied differences in gender or took place at research universities currently under scrutiny by the Trump Admin. 
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-administration-cut-autism-related-research-by-26-so-far-2025-2025-05-16/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
            In June 2025, a review on thimerosal and autism that was due to be presented by anti-vaxxer Lyn Redwood cited a study that didn't exist and had the opposite conclusion of a study posted on the CDC website two days before that found no link between thimerosal and autism.

        <li><u>Trump mobile</u>: 
          In June 2025, the Trump Org announced the launch of Trump mobile, a new cellular service to be ran by his children to capitalize off Trump's last name while he is in office. 
          The service will operate on the 3 major wireless carriers and cost $47.45 a month, in reference to Trump's 45th and 47th presidencies.
          They also announced a new $499 gold smartphone as part of the plan that would be manufactured in the US.

          On June 22, 2025, the US joined Israel in their attacks on Iran, including dropping a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs onto Iran's Fordow nuclear site under a mountain. 
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-under-missile-attack-iran-says-all-options-open-after-us-strikes-2025-06-22/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          The US hit Iran's three main nuclear sites at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow.

          Trump commented on the strikes saying, "It's not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!"
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-under-missile-attack-iran-says-all-options-open-after-us-strikes-2025-06-22/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On June 23, Iran launched a missile attack on an American air base in Qatar, causing no injuries after Iran gave advanced notice of the attack to the US and Qatar beforehand.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-weighs-retaliation-against-us-strikes-nuclear-sites-2025-06-23/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          The same day, Trump announced that the US had brokered a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, with it taking hours for them both to acknowledge they had accepted the ceasefire and accused each other of violating it.
          On June 24, an initial assessment from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said that the US strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program a few months and did not destroy it.
          The White House said the intelligence report was "flat out wrong."
