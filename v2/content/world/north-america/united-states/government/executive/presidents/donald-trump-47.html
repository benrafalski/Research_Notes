      <li><u>Indirect research costs</u>:
        On June 20, 2025, District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston invalidated an NSF policy from May that limited universities to be reimbursed for "indirect costs" of research to just 15% of direct funding, ruling that it was "arbitrary and capricious."

        <li><u>Trump mobile</u>: 
          In June 2025, the Trump Org announced the launch of Trump mobile, a new cellular service to be ran by his children to capitalize off Trump's last name while he is in office. 
          The service will operate on the 3 major wireless carriers and cost $47.45 a month, in reference to Trump's 45th and 47th presidencies.
          They also announced a new $499 gold smartphone as part of the plan that would be manufactured in the US.
