        <li><u>TPS</u>: 
        In 2021, Biden granted TPS to Venezuelans, citing high levels of crime in Venezuela due to instbaility from Maduro.
        On Mar 31, 2025, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco paused a DHS decision to remove temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezualans.
        600,000 Venezualans in the US have TPS, the ruling protects 348,000 of them.
        In the ruling, Chen said "Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes."
        Venezuelan TPS holders are more likely to hold bachelor's degrees than U.S. citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general U.S. population.

        On April 18, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to pause Chen's TRO while they considered the case, due to the Trump admin not showing it would suffer irreparable harm from the TRO.
        <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/court-rejects-trump-bid-end-venezuelan-migrants-legal-status-2025-04-18/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
        On May 19, the Supreme Court paused Chen's TRO while the appeals court considers the case (Jackson was the only one to publicly dissent), allowing Trump to move ahead with ending TPS for Venezuelans.

        On June 24, Noem said the 521,000 Haitians granted TPS under Biden will have their status terminated on September 2 (original date she set in February was for Aug 2).
        <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-end-deportation-relief-haitian-migrants-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
        On July 1, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn blocked Noem's Hatian TPS revokation, saying "Secretary Noem does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation," making her actions "unlawful."

        <li><u>Wrongful Deportations</u>:
          <ul>
            <li><u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u>: 
              In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
              In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
              The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-judge-hear-lawsuit-man-deported-el-salvador-error-2025-04-04/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
              On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-sidelines-doj-lawyer-after-judge-orders-return-man-deported-erroneously-2025-04-06/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
              On April 7, ahead of the deadline, Chief Justice Roberts issued a stay on Xinis' order while they considered the case, after an appeals court refused to pause the TRO for Trump. 
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-facing-monday-deadline-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man-el-salvador-2025-04-07/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
              On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
              In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful.
              <sup>

              </sup>
              On April 11, Xinis ordered Trump to give daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia, saying the Trump admin has "done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia." 
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-orders-trump-administration-advise-its-steps-return-wrongly-deported-2025-04-11/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
              In the coming days, the Trump admin said Abrego was "alive and secure" but that SC's order to "facilitate" the return of him meant they should only "remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here."
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-state-department-says-deported-maryland-resident-alive-secure-el-salvador-2025-04-13/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
              On April 14, 2025, Trump met with El Salvador president Bukele, during the visit, Bukele said he would not return Abrego Garcia and Trump said he would not ask for him back, with both justifying saying Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.
              During the meeting, Pam Bondi said that "facilitate" meant they would just provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia to the US, she also claimed Kilmar had been given a deportation order twice, when he had never been given one.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-says-it-is-not-required-help-wrongly-deported-man-return-us-2025-04-14/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>
              Bukele said he would not return Kilmar since that would be like smuggling a terrorist to the US.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-meet-with-el-salvadors-president-amid-questions-over-deportations-2025-04-14/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
              On April 15, 2025, Xinis ordered DHS and ICE officials to testify under oath about what they were doing to get Abrego Garcia back.
              In the order Xinis said "To date, what the record shows is that nothing has been done (to get Abrego Garcia back). Nothing." 
              She stopped short of ordering Trump to ask El Salvador outright to return Abrego Garcia but said their refusal to do so was "stunning."
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-consider-trumps-compliance-with-order-over-wrongly-deported-man-2025-04-15/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
              On April 16, 2025, Dem Senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador in an attempt to talk to Abrego Garcia but was denied access by the El Salvador's Vice President Felix Ulloa, who also said they were not releasing Abrego Garcia because the US paying to keep him incarcerated.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senator-lands-el-salvador-seeking-release-wrongly-deported-salvadoran-man-2025-04-16/" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>
              In a reversal, on April 17, 2025, Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia at a hotel, confirming he was healthy, Abrego Garcia also said he had been moved from CECOT to a better detention facility 8 days before the meeting.

              </sup>
              Also on April 17, 2025, an appeals court rejected Trumps bid to halt Xinis' TRO and also rejected his bid to prevent Xinis from probing if the Trump admin was in contempt for not returning Kilmar.

              On May 26, 2025, US Rep from Maryland, Glenn Ivey, was denied access to CECOT after travelling to El Salvador to meet Abrego Garcia, despite having made a formal request with the Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S. ahead of the visit.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maryland-congressman-denied-access-see-man-wrongly-deported-el-salvador-2025-05-27/" target="_blank">[15]</a></sup>
              On June 6, 2025, Abrego Garcia was flown back to the US to face criminal charges of transporting illegal immigrants, firearms, and drugs.
              Following the indictment, 15-year veteran of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Nashville, Ben Schrader, resigned in protest.

              On June 22, 2025, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville ordered Abrego be released on bail pending his trial.
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/abrego-garcia-ordered-released-pending-trial-migrant-smuggling-charges-2025-06-23/" target="_blank">[18]</a></sup>
              A few days later Holmes ordered the pre-trial release of Abrego (non-bail release) and restricted Trump  from deporting him while the case played out.

        <li><u>CFPB</u>: 
          On Feb 7, 2025, DOGE gained "read-only" admin access to CFPB computer systems, Musk soon after tweeted out "CFPB RIP."
          Musk has previously vowed to destroy the CFPB, at the same time he is seeking to enter the consumer financial marketplace.
          On the same day, Trump made OMB director Russ Vought to take control of the CFPB, after Trump fired the previous CFPB head Rohit Chopra the week before.
          Vought was a co-author of Project 2025, a chapter of which calls for the CFPB to be dismantled.

          On Feb 9, Vought ordered all CFPB staff to suspend all activities, including the supervising of companies they oversee, leaving the banking sector without any government oversight; Vought was later sued by the National Treasury Employees Union for his action.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-acting-cfpb-chief-halts-all-supervision-companies-2025-02-09/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          Days later, the Enforcement Director Eric Halperin and Supervision Director Lorelei Salas both reigned from the CFPB, citing Vaught's pause order.
          Vought also announced he was zeroing out all CFPB funding for the next quarter, saying the $700 million in cash they had on hand was sufficient.

          This includes $15 billion from Trump's scrapping of a Biden policy to cap credit card late fees at $8 and overdraft fees at $5.
          It also included $3 billion from dropping 22 enforcement cases including against JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Capital One.

        <li><u>Young DOGE Techies</u>: 
            After the creation of DOGE, Musk relied on about a dozen young tech engineers with little government experience to takeover the agency.
            These engineers include Gavin Klinger, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine.  
            Gavin Klinger is a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Major grad from Berkeley in 2020, he was previously a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks, he also has a substack where he wrote an article "the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies"; Klinger was later found to have retweeted post from Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate in the past.

            He did not have a formal conversation with Trump before announcing his exit and his departure was decided "at a senior staff level."

            The back-and-forth included Trump threatening to cut Tesla/SpaceX contracts (causing Tesla stock to drop 14%) and Musk calling for Trump's impeachment.

            A week after the order, Marco Rubio issued a waiver for live-saving humanitarian assistance during the 90 day pause, despite the waiver, numerous cases of life-saving aid not being delivered remained, due to a breakdown in communication at USAID from Trump's overhaul.
            Many aid workers erred on the side of caution and closed their aid programs since the US government became unresponsive to them in weather their programs qualified as "life-saving."

        <li><u>Autism</u>: 
            RFK Jr has claimed that autism is an "epidemic" and that we know that it is caused by "environmental exposure."
            <sup><a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
            Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
            In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
            No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
            Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
            Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
            Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/why-are-autism-rates-rising-2025-01-14/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            Despite Kennedy saying they would go after autism, during the first 4 months of 2025, has reduced funding for autism-related research by an estimated $31 million to $116 million from $147 million in the same period in 2024.
            The funding cuts came because they involved diverse populations, studied differences in gender or took place at research universities currently under scrutiny by the Trump Admin.

          The Pentagon said the decision was tied to concerns that U.S. military stockpiles are too low.

        <li><u>July 2025 Ceasefire Push</u>:
          On July 2, 2025, Trump said Israel had agreed to a 60-day ceasefire with Hamas.
          Hamas said they would consider the ceasefire but reiterated their longheld position that Israel must permanently pull out of Gaza.

          On June 22, 2025, the US joined Israel in their attacks on Iran, including dropping a 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs onto Iran's Fordow nuclear site under a mountain. 
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-under-missile-attack-iran-says-all-options-open-after-us-strikes-2025-06-22/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          The US hit Iran's three main nuclear sites at Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordow.

          Trump commented on the strikes saying, "It's not politically correct to use the term, 'Regime Change,' but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change??? MIGA!!!"
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-under-missile-attack-iran-says-all-options-open-after-us-strikes-2025-06-22/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On June 23, Iran launched a missile attack on an American air base in Qatar, causing no injuries after Iran gave advanced notice of the attack to the US and Qatar beforehand.

          The same day, Trump announced that the US had brokered a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, with it taking hours for them both to acknowledge they had accepted the ceasefire and accused each other of violating it.
          On June 24, an initial assessment from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said that the US strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program a few months and did not destroy it.
          The White House said the intelligence report was "flat out wrong."

          In the coming days after the strikes, the Trump admin began increased deportations of Iranians illegally in the country, with one man saying "I'm on the street of Los Angeles or the street of Tehran?"

          At the summit NATO leaders agreed to increase defense spending from 2% to 5% of GDP to meet Trump's demands.
          This included 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for other defense like cyber security.
          All countries agrees to the new commitment except Spain, who said they would meet their NATO commitments but not to 5% of GDP.
