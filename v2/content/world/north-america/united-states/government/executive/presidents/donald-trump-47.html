        <li><u>Trump Mara-lago Assassination Attempt</u>
          On September 8, 2025, Ryan Routh began his trial for attempting to kill Trump and, facing the prospect of life in prison, opted to fire his legal team and defend himself in court (he has no formal legal training).
          U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case, rejected Routh's proposed questions to prospective jurors in the case, calling them "very much off base" and irrelevant to the proceedings. 
          The questions included queries about pro-Palestinian student activism and Trump's support for a U.S. takeover of Greenland.
          Since firing his team of public defenders in July, Routh has used court filings to propose a "beatdown session" with Trump, floated trading himself for a prisoner held by China or Iran and unsuccessfully sought to introduce expert testimony of his own "narcissism."
          During opening arguments in September 11, Cannon stopped Routh's presentation to the jury after only a few minutes after Routh delved into topics including the origin of the human species, the settlement of the American West and international conflicts.

          </sup>
          On September 23, after just a three day trial, the jury convicted Routh of attempting to assassinate Trump and the four other counts he had faced.
          Routh appeared to try to stab himself with a pen several times after the verdict was revealed in court and had to be restrained by U.S. marshals.
          His daughter Sara also yelled in court that her father had not hurt anyone and she would get him out of prison.
          Routh fled from the golf course without firing a shot after a U.S. Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Trump spotted Routh and the rifle and opened fire, according to witness testimony in the case.

      <h2>Major Issues</h2>
      <h3>Immigration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Birthright Citizenship</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US.
          A day after the EO, 22 Dem-led states, the District of Columbia, and the city if San Fransisco sued Trump in Boston and Seattle and the American Civil Liberties Union immigrant organization also filed seperate lawsuits, both of which said Trump's order violated the 14th amendment.  
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/lawsuits-challenge-trumps-birthright-citizenship-other-orders-2025-01-21/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          Opponents of birthright citizenship say that if the drafters of the 14th amendment wanted all people born in the US to be citizens they would not have said that citizens "be subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
          They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and, by implication, their children.
          However, most scholars dismiss the interpretation, since people in the country illegally are still subject to the laws of the US and are thus "subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.

          On January 23, a Seattle US District judge, John Coughenour, blocked the order from being enforces for 14 days while the judge considers a long-term ruling. 
          Coughenour said the order was "blatantly unconstitutional," referring to the 14th amendment that says any person born in the US is a citizen under the Citizenship Clause.

          On Febrary 6, Coughenour extended his order, setting a nationwide injunction, saying Trump was ignoring the rule of law.

          Trump later appealed the order but was denied on Feb 19, 2025.

          On Febrary 5, a second federal judge, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland, issued a nationwide order blocking Trump from implementing the birthright citizenship EO until the court had ruled on a lawsuit brought to the judge by the CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project immigrant rights groups and 5 pregnant women.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/second-us-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-02-05/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>

          On Febrary 10, a third U.S. District Judge, Joseph Laplante, in Concord blocked Trump's birthright EO, saying he expects the issue to be brought to the Supreme Court.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-order-curtailing-us-birthright-citizenship-blocked-by-third-judge-2025-02-10/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
          On March 13, Trump asked the Supreme Court to narrow the 3 orders against him and that the injunctions should be scaled back from applying universally and should be limited to just the plaintiffs that brought the cases and are "actually within the courts' power."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-intervene-bid-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-03-13/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
          On June 27, the SC ruled 6-3 ordering the 3 lower courts to narrow their nationwide rulings but specified that Trump's EO cannot take effect until 30 days from then.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-may-rule-allowing-enforcement-trump-birthright-citizenship-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>
          On July 10, Judge Joseph Laplante issued another nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order, despite the Supreme Court's ruling, after the ACLU refiled the case as a class action.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-weigh-blocking-trump-birthright-citizenship-despite-supreme-court-ruling-2025-07-10/" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup>
          On July 23, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to uphold Judge Coughenour's decision, agreeing that Trump was violating the 14th Amendment.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-blocks-trumps-order-curtailing-birthright-citizenship-2025-07-24/" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup>
          On July 25, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston said his earlier nationwide injuction would remain in place despite the Supreme Court ruling.
          Sorokin wrote that the evidence before him "does not support a finding that any narrower option would feasibly and adequately protect the plaintiffs from the injuries they have shown they are likely to suffer if the unlawful policy announced in the Executive Order takes effect during the pendency of this lawsuit."

          On October 3, the 1st Circuit upheld Judges Sorokin and Judge Laplante's nationwide injunctions blocking Trump's birthright EO.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/second-us-appeals-court-rejects-trumps-order-curtailing-birthright-citizenship-2025-10-03/" target="_blank">[14]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>Asylum Ban</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed a proclamation, blocking all migrants "engaged in the invasion across the southern border" from claiming asylum. 
          On July 2, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss blocked the proclamation, saying neither federal immigration law nor the U.S. Constitution gave Trump the authority to disregard existing laws and regulations governing the asylum process even if stopping illegal immigration presented "enormous challenges."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-asylum-ban-us-mexico-border-says-he-exceeded-authority-2025-07-02/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On August 1, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially granted Moss's order, saying Trump's order cannot be used to entirely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers.
          On August 4, the Trump Admin instructed CBP to stop deportations under the asylum ban and process migrants under US migration law.

        </li>
        <li><u>TPS</u> 
          In 2021, Biden granted TPS to Venezuelans, citing high levels of crime in Venezuela due to instbaility from Maduro.
          On Mar 31, 2025, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco paused a DHS decision to remove temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezualans.
          600,000 Venezualans in the US have TPS, the ruling protects 348,000 of them.
          In the ruling, Chen said "Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes."
          Venezuelan TPS holders are more likely to hold bachelor's degrees than U.S. citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general U.S. population.
          On April 18, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to pause Chen's TRO while they considered the case, due to the Trump admin not showing it would suffer irreparable harm from the TRO.
          On May 19, the Supreme Court paused Chen's TRO while the appeals court considers the case (Jackson was the only one to publicly dissent), allowing Trump to move ahead with ending TPS for Venezuelans.
          On August 29, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to uphold Chen's decision and that Trump's likely acted unlawfully when revoking TPS for the Venezualans.
          However, Chen's ruling remains on hold while the litigation plays out as a result of the Supreme Court's order.
          On September 3, the Trump admin said they will still be ending TPS for Venezuelans, with it set to expire on September 10.
          On September 5, Judge Chen ruled that Noem lacked the authority to end TPS for the Venezuelans and the decision to do so was motivated by racism.
          Chen said that Noem's justification for cancelling TPS (that the countries were safe to return to) was unjustified since she made that decision without first consulting with relevant federal agencies or conducting a comprehensive review of conditions in the two countries.
          On September 18, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected to block Chen's order.

          On June 24, Noem said the 521,000 Haitians granted TPS under Biden will have their status terminated on September 2 (original date she set in February was for Aug 2).
          On September 5, Judge Chen ruled that Noem lacked the authority to end TPS for the Venezuelans and the decision to do so was motivated by racism.
          Chen said that Noem's justification for cancelling TPS (that the countries were safe to return to) was unjustified since she made that decision without first consulting with relevant federal agencies or conducting a comprehensive review of conditions in the two countries.

          </sup>
          On July 1, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn blocked Noem's Hatian TPS revokation, saying "Secretary Noem does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation," making her actions "unlawful."

          On July 7, Trump said he would be ending TPS for 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans on September 6, despite many of the migrants having been living and working in the US for decades.
          The migrants from both countries had come to the US under TPS after the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, but Trump said TPS was overused and that many immigrants no longer merit protections.

          On July 14, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted an administrative stay on Trump's termination of TPS for Afghans and Cameroons until July 21.
          The DHS originally set TPS termination for Afghans on July 14, while that of Cameroonians was set to end on August 4.

          On August 20, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled to end TPS for immigrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal while court challenges play out, reversing an earlier order from U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson.
          The order immediately ends protections for Nepalis, which expired on August 5, while TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans will expire on September 8.

          Of the 80,000 Somalis in Minnesota, most are U.S. citizens, and there are only 705 Somali-born individuals nationwide who have TPS status and Biden had previously extended TPS for them until March 2026.
          Later, during a Cabinet meeting, Trump referred to Somalis as "garbage" and said "we don't want them in our country".

          On March 21, 2025, Trump revoked the temporary parole status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who were in the US.
          Biden had previously granted to the migrants parole, allowing them to enter the country by air if they had U.S. sponsors.
          Trump made the decision in order the fast track the deportation of the migrants.

          On April 10, US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston blocked Trump from revoking TPS for 450,000 of the migrants but said she would not force the admin to grant further TPS.
          On May 5, Trump's appeal of Talawani's order was rejected.
          On May 28, Judge Talwani ordered Trump to resume processing applications from migrants seeking work permits or more lasting immigration status who are living in the country temporarily under "parole" programs.
          The ruling affected migrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, and Ukraine who were granted a two-year "parole" to live in the country by Biden.
          On May 30, the Supreme Court halted Talwani's order (only Jackson and Sotomayor publicly dissented).
          On September 12, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned overturned Talwani's ruling, saying Noem's action forced parolees to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the US and risk being deported but that the plaintiffs failed to show that Noem lacked authority under INA to categorically end their parole.

        <li><u>H-1B Visas</u>
          In late December 2024, Trump sided with Elon Musk amid a large public dispute over the use of H-1B visas, saying he fully backs the program for foreign tech workers.
          Musk previously vowed to go to "war" to defend the visa program for foreign tech workers.
          Trump previously moved to limit the visas' use during his first presidency but seemed to shift on them now.
          Musk is himself a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has held an H-1B visa, and his company Tesla obtained 724 of the visas in 2024.
          The altercation was set off earlier in the week by far-right activist Laura Loomer who criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration's immigration policies.

          On September 19, 2025, issued a proclamation announcing it would start requiring companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B worker visas.
          Microsoft, JPMorgan, and Amazon responded to the announcement by advising employees holding H-1B visas to remain in or to return to the US before midnight on Saturday when the new fee structures are set to take effect. 
          The number of foreign STEM workers in the U.S. more than doubled between 2000 and 2019 to nearly 2.5 million, even as overall STEM employment only increased 44.5% during that time.
          The move could add millions of dollars in costs for companies, which could hit smaller tech firms and start-ups particularly hard.
          Analysts suggested the fee could force companies to move high-value work overseas, hampering America's position in the AI race with China.
          In 2024, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%.
          In the first half of 2025, Amazon.com had approval for over 12,000 H-1B visas, while Microsoft and Meta Platforms had over 5,000 H-1B visa approvals each.
          Despite tech holding a majority of H-1B visas, their CEOs were overwhelmingly quiet about the announcement, likely due to fear of retaliation from Trump.
          The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
          Usually, nearly all the visa fees are paid by employers, with the H-1B visas being approved for a period of three to six years.
          Panic, confusion and anger reigned as workers on H-1B visas from India and China were forced to abandon travel plans and rush back to the U.S.
          Many criticized the move and the chaotic roll-out with the White House eventually clarifying the hefty fees would be charged just once, not annually, and they would not apply to existing holders including those who happened to be overseas at the time of the announcement.

          Trump's plan also drew concern from the healthcare industry, with foreign-trained physicians filling 20% of US family medicine posts, disproportionately serving rural and underserved areas.
          In 2025, of the 442,000 H-1B visas approved, 5,640 were in healthcare.
          It is also important to note that the US is projected to be short 13,500 to 86,000 physicians by 2036.

          Due to there only being 85,000 annual visas, the annual allotment is taken up as soon as applications open on April 1st. 
          This lottery system is a bad approach due to higher skilled workers having the same opportunity to get a visa as low skilled workers.
          The H1-B lasts for three years and can be extended to six, after which workers must either leave the country or transition to a green card.
          The INA caps the number of green cards to available to applicants from any single country at 7% of the total green cards issued each year, meaning countries with high populations like India and China have really long green card wait times, making their only real route to working in the US being the H1-B visa.

          According to Pew Research, 57% of H1-B workers had a master's degree and 34% had a bachelor's degree.
          This means most H-1B workers study at a university and most of them do so in the US, paying higher fees than US-born students in the process, so they can stay after and get a job in the US.
          With Trump's new fee, this would make so H-1B talent will leave US universities, due to them not being able to get a job in the US after graduating.
          It also incentivises US firms to hire workers from abroad rather than investing in training domestic talent, which was seen during Trump's first term when H-1B's were under scrutiny.
          In 2025, at least 36 universities announced budget cuts in response to Trump administration policies including from reduced federal research grants, an expected drop in international student enrollment and other financial pressures.
          In November 2025, the Institute of International Education released a report that newly enrolled international students at U.S. colleges and universities dropped by 17% in 2025, with most respondents citing application concerns and travel restriction as the reason for not enrolling.

          A census report found that 72% of US STEM graduates work in non-STEM occupations.
          Among the 13.7 million STEM majors working in non-STEM jobs, 36 percent earn more than STEM majors do in STEM jobs. 
          The median STEM major in a STEM job made $110,000 in 2023. 
          Over 4.9 million STEM majors earned at least that much in non-STEM jobs that year. 
          That total is comparable to the 5.1 million STEM majors who work in STEM jobs in total.
          This means that STEM majors might be choosing to work in non-STEM jobs, or that companies are choosing lower paid H-1B workers over higher paid US STEM workers.

          Trump administration officials say the visa allows companies to suppress wages, and curbing it opens more jobs for U.S. tech workers. 
          Supporters of the program argue that it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive.
          In a 2017 NBER study, they found using data from the 1994-2001 tech boom, that there was a substantial rise in foreign high skill workforce from H-1B visas.
          They found that foreign labor had positive effects on labor and firms earned substantially higher outcome due to the workers.
          They also found that despite immigration increasing the overall welfare of US natives it also caused wages for US computer scientists to be 2.6% to 5.1% lower and caused employment in computer science for US workers to be 6.1% to 10.8% lower in 2001. 
          On the other hand, immigration also lowered prices and raised the output of IT goods by between 1.9% and 2.5%, benefiting consumers.
          In a 2016 Berkeley paper, they said "Our primary finding on employment is that additional H-1Bs at most increase total firm employment by a moderate amount. The preponderance of evidence indicates that H-1B workers at least partially crowd out other workers… We find an insignificant effect of additional H-1B visas on patenting and the R&E credit… Overall, our results are more supportive of the narrative in which marginal H-1Bs crowd out other workers, are paid less than alternative workers, and increase the firm's profits—despite little effect on measures of the quantity of firm innovation.""
          One reason that H1-B workers are paid less is because they are typically younger workers.

        <li><u>Alien Enemies Act</u>: 
          On March 15, 2025, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, saying the United States was facing an "invasion." 
          Under Trump's proclamation, all Venezuelan citizens 14+ years of age and determined to be members of the gang and are in the US illegally, are subject to the Alien Enemies act.
          The Alien Enemies Act is best known for its use to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during WW2.

          The ACLU had previously sued Trump for the 5 Venezualan deportations, saying they had been misidentified as being part of Tren de Aragua.

          On April 18, a classified assessment from the National Intelligence Council that drew from 18 intelligence agencies repeatedly stated that TdA is not coordinated with or supported by Maduro or senior Venezualean officials.
          However, the report did find that TdA had minimal contact with low-level members of the Venezualean government.
          Of the 18 agencies involved, only the FBI disagreed, saying they thought Maduro was "likely" weaponizing TdA against the US.
          After the report was made public, Gabbard's acting chief of staff Joe Kent ordered a "new assessment written on TDA and their relationship with the government of Venezuela that reflects basic common sense."

        <li><u>Third Country Deportations</u>
          On March 28, 2025, US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued a nationwide TRO designed to protect migrants subject to final orders of removal from being swiftly deported to countries other than those that had already been identified during immigration proceedings.
          The National Immigration Litigation Alliance brought the case against Trump after ICE began using a fast-tracked deportation system.
          Murphy said that under the Convention Against Torture, migrants had protections against being removed to countries where they face a likelihood of torture.

          On April 7, an appeals court rejected Trump's bid to have Murphy's TRO lifted, saying that such an order generally cannot be appealed, unlike longer-term preliminary injunctions.

          On April 18, Murphy issued a preliminary injunction, barring Trump from conducting final order deportations without giving the deportees asylum hearings to ensure they would not be tortured or killed.

          On May 7, US District Judge Brian Murphy issued an order restricting Trump from deporting migrants to Libya, despite Libya's harsh treatment of detainees.
          Murphy said the deportations would clearly violate his prior court order barring officials from swiftly deporting migrants to countries other than their own without first weighing whether they risk persecution or torture if sent there.
          When asked about the deportations, Trump said he didn't know anything about them, "You'll have to ask Homeland Security."
          Libya's Government of National Unity said it rejected the use of Libyan territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent and there was no coordination with the US on the issue. 
          Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army, which controls eastern Libya, also rejected the idea.

          On May 21, Murphy ordered Trump not to deport eight migrants convicted of serious crimes including homicides to South Sudan, saying it would be a violation of his court order.
          Later the same day, Murphy ruled that Trump violated his court order by attempting to deport migrants to South Sudan, saying government officials risked being held in contempt of court.
          Murphy said the DHS failed to provide six migrants covered by his injunction a meaningful opportunity to contest being sent to South Sudan when it notified them of that possibility less than 24 hours before they were loaded onto a plane.

          After the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump sent eight migrants from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam to South Sudan.
          The admin also began pressuring five African nations - Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon - to accept deportees from elsewhere.
          On July 13, an ICE memo said they will only give immigrants six hours notice before deporting them to third countries (was previously 24-hours).

          On August 2, Reuters found that two men from Vietnam, two men from Laos and a man from Mexico were all deported to their home nations after having previously being threatened with deportation to Libya.
          In June, DHS said third-country deportations allow them to deport people "so uniquely barbaric that their own countries won't take them back."

          On September 16,  D.C.-based District Judge Tanya Chutkan said advocacy groups representing five migrants from Nigeria and Gambia that were deported to Ghana failed to demonstrate why the case should be before her, since she lacked jurisdiction.
          However, Chutkan said the deportations of the West African migrants appeared to be an attempt to skirt U.S. immigration courts by quickly sending them to another nation.
          On September 23, the eleven people who were deported to Ghana were deported again, with six going to Togo and the others unknown.

        <li><u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u> 
          In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
          In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
          The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).

          On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").

          On April 7, ahead of the deadline, Chief Justice Roberts issued a stay on Xinis' order while they considered the case, after an appeals court refused to pause the TRO for Trump. 
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-facing-monday-deadline-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man-el-salvador-2025-04-07/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
          In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful.

          On April 11, Xinis ordered Trump to give daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia, saying the Trump admin has "done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia."

          In the coming days, the Trump admin said Abrego was "alive and secure" but that SC's order to "facilitate" the return of him meant they should only "remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here."

          On April 14, 2025, Trump met with El Salvador president Bukele, during the visit, Bukele said he would not return Abrego Garcia and Trump said he would not ask for him back, with both justifying saying Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.
          During the meeting, Pam Bondi said that "facilitate" meant they would just provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia to the US, she also claimed Kilmar had been given a deportation order twice, when he had never been given one.

          In the order Xinis said "To date, what the record shows is that nothing has been done (to get Abrego Garcia back). Nothing." 
          She stopped short of ordering Trump to ask El Salvador outright to return Abrego Garcia but said their refusal to do so was "stunning."

          On July 23, U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw rejected a challenge to keep Abrego detained, writing that prosecutors had not shown sufficient evidence that Abrego posed a public safety threat or was a flight risk to justify his continued detention ahead of trial.
          After Crenshaw's order, Holmes said she would delay her order for release by at least 30 days.
          On the same day, Judge Xinis ruled that if Abrego is released from criminal custody, ICE could not detain him in Tennessee and that his immigration case must be returned to Maryland, and that he must be notified at least three days before any deportation to a third country.

          DHS said ICE had conducted an investigation into the site for seven months and the workers were barred from working in the U.S. after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas.
          Many of the people arrested were skilled workers who were sent to the U.S. to install equipment at the near-complete factory on a visa waver programme, or B-1 business traveller visas, which largely did not allow work.
          For years, South Korean companies said they struggled to obtain short-term work visas for specialists needed in their high-tech plants and had come to rely on a grey zone of looser interpretation of visa rules under previous American administrations.

          Under a 1982 Supreme Court ruling, all children regardless of immigration status are entitled to a free K-12 education.
          On February 19, 2025, Trump's signed executive order "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders" aimed to target a Biden policy of using the parole authority to temporarily allow illegal immigrants into the US including 900,000 from the Mexico border, 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew, and 300,000 from Ukraine and Afghanistan.
          Those granted parole for at least a year are "qualified non-citizens," making them eligible for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (child coverage if you make too much for Medicaid), but only after 5 years

          The law did not define what programs count as "federal public benefits," leaving the interpretation up to federal agencies.
          The newly added banned programs included the Head Start preschool programs for low-income children, various grants or programs for substance use recovery and prevention, the Title X Family Planning Program, health workforce programs, and projects for helping people transition from homelessness.

          The cities all have laws and policies that limit or prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal officers with civil immigration arrests.
          Orrick previously ruled against a similar EO from Trump's first term, the ruling was upheld in an appeals court.
          On May 8, Judge Orrick ordered Trump not to use a new April sanctuary cities EO he signed ("Protecting American Communities From Criminal Aliens") to bypass his earlier PI that Orrick previously issued in relation to sanctuary cities.

          On April 17, Boasberg ruled that there was probable cause to believe the government had violated his order to return migrants from El Salvador he had made on Mar 15 and that they could face contempt charges.
          On April 19, an appeals court put on hold Boasberg's threat of contempt charges.
          On June 24, Erez Reuveni, the former DOJ official who was fired after admitting in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, submitted a whistleblower complaint that Bove pressured DOJ attorneys do defy court orders that blocked migrant removals.
          This included Bove telling colleagues in a March 14 meeting they could consider defying future court orders by telling the courts "fuck you" so that Venezuelan and El Salvador bound planes could take off, Bove denied making such statements in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
          On July 10, US Senate Democrats released internal DOJ text messages and emails coroborating the allegations that Bove directed the defiance of court orders.
          In a March 15 text exchange between Reuveni and his supervisor August Flentje (also was at the March 14 Bove meeting) one of them wrote: "Guess it's time to find out on the 'fuck you.'" "Yup. It was good working with you," the other responded.
          The two then discussed how shocked they were that the DOJ had lied to Boasberg about knowing whether flights were due to depart in the next 24 hours.
          "He knows there are plans for (Alien Enemies Act) removals within the next 24 hours," one of them wrote. "Yes he does," the other replied.
          On August 8, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals sided with the government by a 2-1 vote to overturn Boasberg's contempt ruling, saying "The District Court's order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses."

          On July 28, the DOJ filed a misconduct complaint against Judge Boasberg, 
          The DOJ complaint focused on comments Boasberg made during a meeting of the judiciary's top policymaking body in March that was attended by Chief Justice John Roberts in which Boasberg expressed his concern to Roberts and others that the Trump administration would disregard court rulings and trigger "a constitutional crisis."
          The DOJ argued those comments eroded public confidence in judicial neutrality and ran afoul of the judicial code of conduct and accused him of then acting on his belief by issuing his order that blocked the president from using wartime powers to deport Venezuelan migrants.

        <li><u>New Census</u>
          On August 7, 2025 Trump ordered the Commerce Department to begin work on a new census that excludes immigrants in the US illegally (next census wasn't for 2030).
          Trump's order revisited a push from his first term in which he added a contentious citizenship question the 2020 census but was later blocked by the Supreme Court which said the federal government gave a "contrived" rationale.
          After taking office, President Biden issued an executive order affirming the long standing practice of including all people residing in a state in the official count but Trump revoke that order on his first day during his second term.
          Republicans argue that excluding immigrants in the US illegally would benefit Republican districts and hurt urban areas, which are often Democrat controlled, with the counter argument being that if you don't count everyone you end up misspending money on infrastructure, hospitals, schools, power grids, and water.

        <li><u>Truck Drivers</u>
          On April 28, 2025, Trump signed an order directing enforcement of a rule requiring commercial drivers in the U.S. to meet English-proficiency standards.
          While the English-proficiency standard for truckers was already longstanding U.S. law, but Trump's order reversed 2016 guidance that inspectors not place commercial drivers out of service if their only violation was lack of English.
          On August 21, Rubio paused the issuance of all worker visas for commercial truck drivers.
          The move came after a crash on a Florida highway killed three people involving a driver who was an Indian national and did not speak English or have legal authorization to be in the United States.
          FMCSA said in 2023 that about 16% of U.S. truck drivers were born outside the United States.

        <li><u>Unaccompanied Children</u>
          On August 31, US District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued a TRO that halted the Trump administration from deporting 10 migrant Guatemalan children already boarded onto planes for 14 days after their lawyers made a pre-dawn emergency appeal.
          The Trump admin had previously struck an agreement with Guatemala that would allow unaccompanied children to be sent back to the country and planned to start deportations the same weekend of the order.
          Migrant children who arrive at U.S. borders without a parent or guardian are classified as unaccompanied and sent to federal government-run shelters until they can be placed with a family member or foster home.
          DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said no children had been removed but that some had been loaded onto planes and that he believed one plane may have taken off but later returned under the judge's order.
          Earlier in the week, Melissa Johnston, director of the HHS' unaccompanied children program, sent an email to staff prohibiting the U.S. release of Guatemalan children in federal custody except for those sponsored by parents or legal guardians in the country.
          The complaint said that in Guatemala, the children "may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests."
          Among the plaintiffs was a 10-year-old indigenous Guatemalan girl whose mother had died and who had suffered abuse and neglect from other caretakers, she was detained at a U.S. government shelter in South Texas.
          Several of the 10 plaintiffs had expressed fear of returning to Guatemala, the complaint said.
          On September 3, an internal Guatemalan government report revealed that Guatemalan authorities had contacted the families of 115 minors who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or guardian and of those, 59 families expressed anger about the possibility of their children being returned to Guatemala, with some even describing it as intimidation.
          The report contradicted claims by the Trump admin, including Stephen Miller saying that the children were being reunited with their parents.
          After the report was submitted to the court, the DOJ withdrew their statement that the parents had requested the deportations.
          On September 13, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, based in Washington, D.C., who the case was move to, extended the TRO blocking the deportations. 
          On September 18, Kelly kept in place the earlier judicial block on the policy, sharply criticizing the administration's unproven assertion that the children's parents wanted them deported.

        <li><u>ICE Tactics</u>
          In mid September, 2025, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation preventing ICE officers from wearing masks to hide their identities.
          Critics of mask-wearing says it stifles accountability, while Trump officials say officers need to wear them to avoid being targeted.
          By later September, there were multiple high-profile incidents of ICE officers using force during arrests, following the gutting of their oversight offices including the office charged with investigating civil rights violations by personnel.
          These included ICE throwing a Guatemalan woman to the ground in Boston despite her being a permanent resident and an ICE officer <a href="https://x.com/propublica/status/1971387520400425057" target="_blank">charging</a> a woman in NY who was begging officers not to take away her husband, resulting in the officer being placed on leave (then later reinstated).
          There was also an incident where ICE officers shoved and injured journalists, causing one of them to be taken to the hospital.
          ICE also used tear gas, less-lethal rounds, flash bang grenades and pepper balls to quell protests outside an immigration detention center in Chicago, during one of the near-daily protests at the facility.

        <li><u>LA Riots</u>
          On June 9, 2025, Trump sent 2000 National Guard troops to help quell protests that had been going on for 3 days in LA in response to various ICE raids.
          Gavin Newsom called Trump's deployment unlawful and requested their withdrawl.
          Trump used Section 12406 of Title 10 that allows the deployment of the National Guard into federal service if the U.S. is invaded, there is a "rebellion or danger of rebellion" or the president is "unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."
          During the protests, multiple Waymo cars were set on fire and protestors threw concrete and bottles at LAPD officers.
          Eventually the LAPD declared all of downtown LA to be an unlawful assembly.

          On June 10, in a highly unusual use if US military personnel, Trump sent 2000 more Nationa Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA as the protests spread to neighboring Orange County, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Austin.
          LA Mayor Karen Bass said 100 people were arrested after cars were set on fire and several businesses were looted including an Apple store and a CVS pharmacy, she but that most of the protestors were non-violent.
          During the night of June 10, Bass imposed a curfew for 8pm on downtown LA after more lootings took place.

          On July 7, troops were deployed to MacArthur Park in LA after the DHS suspected it was an open-air market for fake identification.
          It was later revealed that Army Major General Scott Sherman had rejected the DHS original request for troops because he believed there was little need for military protection but he was eventually overruled by Hegseth.
          According to a July 1 Army planning document, the operation was "extremely high" risk with the addition of troops and created the potential for violent protests with the possibility for "miscommunication and fratricide" as well as accidental harm to civilians, including children.

          On August 11, a three day non-jury trial began before U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer will determine whether the government violated the law when he deployed the troops in June.
          In the first day's testimony, U.S. Army Major General Scott Sherman, who until recently commanded the military operations in LA, testified about an internal military intelligence assessment that concluded there would be little risk to federal property and personnel during a July 7 immigration enforcement operation at a Los Angeles park.
          Sherman said a DHS official criticized him and questioned his loyalty to the country after he denied an initial request for military assistance for the operation but a different request for assistance was later approved by Hegseth, Sherman said.

          On September 2, Judge Breyer found that Trump violated the Posse Comitatus Act with its June deployment of the National Guard and the Marines to LA.
          Breyer put the ruling on hold until September 12 for Trump to appeal.
          The injunction applies only to the military in California, not nationally.
          Breyer wrote in his ruling that "There is no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety."

        <li><u>Washington DC</u>
          In Federalist No. 43, published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.
          The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government to not rely on any state for its own security.
          In 1789, Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution permited the establishment of a "District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States"
          The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. 
          Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government.
          As such, Washington, D.C., is not part of any state, and is not one itself. 
          Today, D.C. has a population size of 700,000, so the founders would most likely favor a compromise that preserves federal control over the core federal district as a neutral ground for federal officials but grant fuller local autonomy to the residential parts of D.C., so residents aren't disenfranchised.

          On August 3, 2025, DOGE worker Edward Coristine, known as "Big Balls.", was assaulted in a carjacking in Washington, D.C. involving 10 attackers.
          The attack prompted Trump to announce his plans for a law enforcement surge and National Guard deployment to D.C.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/two-more-arrested-attempted-carjacking-doge-staffer-washington-dc-2025-10-20/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
          On August 11, Trump invoked the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control.
          The Democratic mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, has authority over the city's Metropolitan Police Department but the Home Rule Act allows the president to take control of the MPD for up to 30 days during emergencies if "special conditions of an emergency nature exist."
          Trump also deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to "re-establish law, order, and public safety," the president is the commander in chief of the D.C. National Guard.
          The president has broad authority over the 2,700 members of the D.C. National Guard, unlike in states where governors typically hold the power to activate troops.
          Guard troops have been dispatched to Washington many times, including in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
          He also said "Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals" and said D.C. crime was worse that Bogota and Mexico City, despite violent crime in DC being at a 30-year low in 2024.
          Violent crime fell 26% in the first seven months of 2025 after dropping 35% in 2024, and overall crime dropped 7%, according to the city's police department.
          However, gun violence remains an issue with Washington having the third-highest gun homicide rate among U.S. cities with populations over 500,000 in 2023, according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.
          The homicide rate in the nation's capital was the fourth highest among 24 U.S. cities in 2024, according to a report by the Center for Public Safety Initiatives at Rochester Institute of Technology.
          A CCJ report on crime in Washington showed carjacking rose during 2020 and spiked to a peak of 140 reported incidents, a rate of 20.6 per 100,000 residents, in June 2023 but in June 2025, there were 36 reported incidents, or a rate of 5.1.
          A Reuters/Ipsos poll from August 27 found that just 38% of Americans support using troops for law enforcement in the U.S. capital, with 46% opposed.

          On August 16, the governors from three Republican states sent their National Guard troops to D.C. at Trump's request, including 300-400 from West Virginia, 200 from South Carolina, and 150 from Ohio.
          On August 18, the Republican governors of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee also agreed to deploy troops to Washington at Trump's request, bringing the total number of National Guard troops in the city to over 1,100.
          However, one Republican governor, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott "politely declined" the federal request.
          The White House said that Guard troops may carry arms but were not making arrests and instead were protecting federal property and providing "a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests."
          On August 24, National Guard troops in D.C. began carrying firearms.
          Most of the guard troops mingled with tourists, posed for selfies, and treated themselves to ice cream from food trucks along Washington's National Mall (Ward 2), one of the safest parts of America's capital.
          "It's boring. We're not really doing much," said Sergeant Fox, who declined to give his first name.
          The troop concentration was near the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial (both Ward 2) and in view of the U.S. Capitol (Ward 6), highlighting that Trump's deployment was just a show of force.
          By contrast with central Washington, residents of Ward 7 and Ward 8 - the area with the highest crime rate - said there was not a guardsman in sight.
          A White House official said that between Aug. 9 and Aug. 17, there had been a total of 212 non-immigration related arrests and of those, 101 were in Wards 7 and 8.

          On August 18, the White House began dispatching social media teams alongside FBI agents executing arrest warrants in D.C. to generate political videos that promote Trump's crackdown on crime.
          The arrangement runs afoul of longstanding DOJ norms which seek to insulate criminal investigations from political influence and could hamstring prosecutors' ability to try their cases by generating pre-trial publicity and raise constitutional questions about suspects' rights to privacy in cases involving arrests carried out in non-public areas.
          The White House posted a highly produced promotional video on X documenting the arrest of Sean Charles Dunn, a now-former DOJ employee who was facing an assault charge after he hurled a Subway sandwich at a federal agent.
          On August 27, a federal grand jury declined to indict Sean Dunn on felony charges for throwing the sandwich (guess Trump's prosecutors can't indict a ham sandwich).

          On August 19, the DOJ opened an investigation into whether D.C. manipulated its statistics to make crime rates appear lower.
          On August 27, the House Oversight Committee opened an investigation into the MPD after it heard from a whistleblower with knowledge of internal MPD operations who shared allegations that "crime statistics were manipulated on a widespread basis and at the direction of supervisory officials." 
          There have been long-standing complaints within the department that managers have reclassified crimes to downplay the level of danger in their police districts and avoid scrutiny from higher-ups.
          In a 2020, a D.C. police veteran Sgt. Charlotte Djossou claimed in a lawsuit that the MPD retaliated against her after she raised concerns about the conduct of some supervisors, including allegations of efforts to "distort crime statistics" to make it appear crime was down.
          She described in the lawsuit how felony thefts were tallied as misdemeanors and also claimed that in 2019, she arrived at the scene of a domestic violence assault involving a knife — which she considered "an unambiguous felony" — but discovered that a lieutenant had downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor of simple assault.

          On August 27, a Reuters review of more than 500 criminal cases filed in D.C. local court since August 11 found Trump's anti-crime task force was involved in at least 69 local cases over the past two weeks, of which nearly half were comparatively minor offenses, including misdemeanors.
          The rest were felonies under the local D.C. code, not the more serious federal felonies that agencies usually handle and about half of those were for carrying a firearm without a license, possessing drugs with intent to distribute, or both.
          None of the cases Reuters reviewed involved someone being charged with a violent offense.

          On August 26, Trump said the U.S. government will start seeking the death penalty in Washington, D.C., homicide cases.
          Seeking the death penalty for homicides in Washington would likely drastically increase the number of defendants on federal death row since such cases often take many years to work through the court system given the number of appeals available to defendants.
          On September 25, Trump sidnged a proclomation allowing for the death penalty in DC.

          On August 27, the Trump admin said it planned to reclaim management of Washington Union Station, citing safety concerns.
          In March, the White House forced the CEO of U.S. passenger railroad company Amtrak, Stephen Gardner, to step down following orders by Trump.
          Trump, during his first term, repeatedly sought to cut funding to Amtrak, which received about $2.4 billion in annual federal support in 2023. 
          Congress in March approved $2.42 billion for Amtrak through September 30 in annual funding.

          On September 18, the HHS internal watchdog office began investigating whether people caught up in Trump's Washington crime crackdown were improperly enrolled in federal benefits including Medicare, Medicaid or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF).
          The investigations have tied up resources inside the department that would normally pursue bigger, high-dollar fraud cases tied to illegal billing practices and unlawful kickbacks.

          <u>Report Card</u>:
          In October 2025, Trump declared victory over the "crisis" of crime in Washington, and floated the idea of using such deployments to U.S. cities as training grounds for the military.
          The White House said over the 30 days, total crime dropped 17 percent, homicide dropped 50 percent, assaults with dangerous weapons dropped 16 percent and robberies dropped 22 percent from the same period the year before.
          In the months before the surge, there were seven violent crimes each day, then it dropped in mid-August to five-six per day, then it rose back to seven by the last half of September.
          However, the number of violent crimes that involve firearms dropped more noticeably to 65 reports a day, from 97 in the four weeks before the surge.

          <div><u>ICE Escalation</u>
            On September 8, 2025, authorities released a video of a Ukrainian refugee, Iryna Zarutska, who was fatally stabbed while on a train in North Carolina.
            The video gained national attention and Trump used the the murder to justify plans to expand his crime crackdown in Chicago.
            The killer, Decarlos Brown, was charged with first-degree murder and later with a federal murder change, he has a long criminal history, spent several years in prison for armed robbery, and also had a history of mental health issues.
            Earlier in 2025, he was charged with misusing 911 after he told officers someone had put a "man-made" material inside his body to control him but was only charged with a misdemeanor rather than a more serious felony and was released without bail by a magistrate judge.
            Brown's mother said she previously had him involuntarily committed and that he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
            Trump said showed he should have been behind bars and used the case to criticize Democratic crime policies.

            Also on September 8, Trump launched deportation crackdown "Operation Midway Blitz" in Illinois aimed at convicted gang members, rapists, kidnappers and drug traffickers who the DHS called "the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens in Chicago."
            Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, both Democrats, each said their offices had received no official notice from federal authorities about the operation, which undercut Trump's crime fighting rationale (crime enforcement requires coordination).
            On September 12, and ICE agent shot and killed a man in the Chicago area as officers attempted to detain him during Operation Midway Blitz. 
            ICE officers were conducting a vehicle stop to arrest Silverio Villegas-Gonzalez when he drove his car at the officers, resulting in an ICE officer firing at Villegas-Gonzalez after being dragged by his vehicle.
            DHS claimed Villegas-Gonzalez was "a criminal illegal alien" with "a history of reckless driving," but he had no criminal record and was only cited for a handful of traffic offenses, one for driving more than 30 miles per hour over the speed limit and others including a ticket for driving an uninsured vehicle and having a broken tail light.
            Villegas-Gonzalez was a father of two and had been sober for over a year after years of alcohol abuse led to him being diagnosed with liver cancer.
            The officer was injured and in stable condition.
            However, on September 23, body cam fottage of the incident was released, showing the ICE officer that was dragged describing his injuries as "nothing major", contradicting ICE's earlier statement that he had "severe injuries".

            On October 4, US Border Patrol agents in Chicago shot an armed woman, who was a US citizen, five times after she rammed her car into an ICE vehicle.
            The incident occured amid ongoing protests at Broadview, a majority-Black village about 13 miles west of Chicago, where on at least four occasions, about a dozen demonstrators sitting on the ground attempting to block ICE vehicles from carrying detainees into the facility have been repelled by heavily armed ICE agents using physical force, chemical munitions and rubber bullets, evoking combat scenes.
            Governor JB Pritzker said he was given an ultimatum by Trump to deploy the state's National Guard, which he rejected, resulting in Trump saying he would deploy 300 troops himself.
            The same day, Border Patrol carried out a late-night raid on an apartment building the city, where they targeted gang members but instead swept up U.S. citizens and families.
            37 were arrested for immigration violations in the operation, with two being from TdA and six having criminal histories, ranging from battery to marijuana possession.

          On October 2, Hegseth signed a memo aimed at halting spurious investigations into military fraud and abuse by forcing IG offices to decide whether tips are backed by "credible evidence" within seven days and to track any "repeat complainants."
          Some officials agreed with Hegseth that complaints can be used to settle scores within the vast military bureaucracy.
          Proponents said the memo could mean fewer frivolous complaints, allowing investigators to focus on more important tips, while critics argued they could ultimately hamper oversight, weaken the independence of the IG and put whistleblowers in an impossible situation.

        <li><u>Probationary workers</u> 
          On March 13, 2025, 2 US District Judges, James Bredar in Baltimore and William Alsup in San Francisco, issued TROs ordering Trump to reinstate thousands of probationary workers accross 19 agencies, including CFPB and USAID, for illegally firing them.
          Judge Bredar said "The sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees' individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct."
          Judge Alsup said "It is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie."
          Earlier in March, the Merit Systems Protection Board ordered 6000 probationary employees at the USDA be reinstated.
          The Trump admin later admitted to firing 24,500 probationary (previously they didn't publicly), and said they began reinstating them on March 18, 2025, but they just placed them on administrative leave instead.
          On Mar 21, Trump's appeal to have Bredar's TRO paused was rejected.
          On Mar 26, Trump's appeal to have Alsup's order paused was rejected.
          On April 1, Bredar narrowed his earlier TRO to only apply to the 19 Dem states who were suing Trump in the case, not the entire US as in his earlier ruling.
          On April 8, the Supreme Court paused Alsup's order, saying that some of the plantiffs in the case didn't have standing.
          On April 9, Bredar's TRO was also paused by an appeals court, who said they likely didn't have standing.
          On September 8, an appeals court overturned Bredar's injunction in a 2-1 ruling, saying the states didn't have standing.
          On September 13, Alsup ruled in a preliminary conclusion Office of Personnel Management unlawfully ordered numerous agencies to fire probationary employees en masse, but didn't order them be reinstated due to the Supreme Court decisions.

          After Trump took office, he fired Dem member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA), Susan Tsui Grundmann, without providing a reason. 
          On March 12, 2025, US District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan in DC ruled that FLRA members may only be removed "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office," and rejected Trump's defense that these protections were unconstitutional.
          The decision gives the FLRA a 2-1 Democratic majority until her term expires in July.
          Sooknanan said Trump's move had undermined Congress' goal of insulating the FLRA from politics.
          A DOJ lawyer at a hearing did not deny that Trump violated the law, but argued that the restrictions on the removal of FLRA members are unconstitutional.

          On July 3, the U.S. Court of Appeals in DC paused Sooknanan's order pending the appeal, saying the law shielding members of the FLRA from being removed at will likely violated Trump's broad powers to control the executive branch.

          FTC commissioners are appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, there are five of them and only three can be from the same political party.
          A unanimous 1935 Supreme Court decision known as Humphrey's Executor, allows the firing of FTC commissioners only for good cause, such as neglecting their duties.

          On July 17, U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan said the Trump administration's attempt to remove one of the FTC commissioners, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, did not comply with removal protections in federal law and that it was illegal.

          On February 21, 2025, Trump fired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, in an unprecedented move.
          The chairman is meant to be apolitical and serve between multiple presidents, Brown's term was to end in 2027.
          Hegseth previously questioned if Brown would have gotten the position if he were not black.
          He also fired the head of the Navy and air force vice chief of staff Admiral Lisa Franchetti.
          In a suprise pick, Trump chose Dan Caine, a retired 3 star general, to be the next chairman; Caine was confimed by the Senate in a 60-25 vote in April 2025.
          On February 27, William Perry, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, Lloyd Austin, and Beyond Mattis, all former defense secretaries, signed a scathing letter criticizing Trump's firing of Brown, saying he was making the military a political arm, and called for Congress not to confirm Dan Caine.
          On February 28, US Army Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, the head of the military's Defense Health Agency and one of the most senior Black female officers in the Army was forced to retire by the Trump admin after 32 years of service.
          On May 5, Hegseth further ordered a 25% reduction in four-star officers at the Pentagon.

          Haugh was not present in the leaked Signal group chat and was fired without explanation.
          Haugh's firing came a day after Laura Loomer met with Trump with a list of national security staff whom she said were disloyal.

          Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, an Asia expert who was a State Department official focused on North Korea during Trump's first term, is also being forced from his post.
          The firing came in the wake of the Signalgate scandal and a broader national security purge from the Laura Loomer list.

          After the tariff announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is keeping rates on hold, concerned tariffs will drive up inflation.
          Trump responded to this by saying Powell's termination "cannot come fast enough," while calling for the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates, pressure Powell said he would resist.
          Powell's term ends in May 2026, when Trump will get to appoint a new chair.
          In the coming weeks, Trump threatened that he could fire Powell if he wanted to and replace him with Kevn Warsh (former Fed governor) or Kevin Hassett (Trump econ adviser).

          Trump said the Bloomberg report was not true but that he had floated the idea to Republican lawmakers.
          Trump said "I don't rule out anything, but I think it's highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud," in reference to OMB director Russell Vought's letter to Powell saying that Trump was "extremely troubled" by the renovations of two Fed buildings, which prompted Powell to request the Fed's inspector general to review the project.

          On July 24, Trump made a rare visit to the Fed to meet Powell amid his continued criticism of the Fed over rates and their renovations.
          Powell typically spends the Thursday afternoon before a rate-setting meeting doing back-to-back calls with Fed bank presidents as part of his preparations for the session.
          During the visit, Trump claimed the renovation project was estimated to cost $3.1 billion, "I am not aware of that," Powell said, shaking his head before Trump handed him a piece of paper, which Powell examined and daid "You just added in a third building," noting that the Martin Building had been completed five years ago.

          The latest policy decision was made by a 9-2 vote, which passes for a split outcome at the consensus-driven central bank, with two Fed governors dissenting for the first time in more than 30 years.

          On August 20, Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the central bank.
          Trump's comments came after U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte alleged in an X post that Cook had designated a condo in Atlanta as her primary residence after taking a loan on her home in Michigan, which she also declared as a primary residence.
          Loans for a primary residence can carry a lower mortgage rate than for second homes or investment properties. 
          Pulte said the loans date to mid-2021, before Cook was appointed to the Fed by Biden.
          Pulte asked AG Bondi to investigate, and Trump quickly amplified the allegation.
          On September 4, the DOJ opened a criminal mortgage fraud probe into Cook.
          The DOJ historically would only pursue cases in which a financial institution suffered significant loss.
          Since 2017, the DOJ has only 20 times charged someone for misstating their primary residences on mortgage applications and of those 20 cases, only one was a standalone criminal charge for misstatements on a mortgage application.

          On August 26, Trump said he was firing Cook "effective immediately" over questions raised over her mortgages.
          Cook's term lasts until 2038 but the Federal Reserve Act allows removal of a sitting governor "for cause," something no President has done before Trump.
          Trump said in a letter to Cook that he had "sufficient cause to remove you from your position" due to the mortgages.
          Cook responded that "no causes exist under the law, and he has no authority" to remove her and that she "will continue to carry out my [her] duties to help the American economy."
          Since Cook was vetted by the Senate already, Trump using her mortgage issues from before her appointment as "for cause" is legally dubious.

          On September 5, Reuters reported that Mark and Julie Pulte, the father and stepmother of Bill Pulte, have claimed so-called "homestead exemptions" for residences in wealthy neighborhoods in both Michigan and Florida. 
          The exemption is meant to give a discount to homeowners on taxes for properties they use as their primary residence.

          The Merit Systems Protection Board is a three-member board that rules on reinstating workers who feel they have been fired incorrectly.
          The law that created the board allows members to be removed only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."
          On Mar 4, 2025, District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Trump illegally fired Harris and she was reinstated, also saying the agency's "mission and purpose require independence."
          On Mar 28, 2025, Contreras' ruling was overturned by an appeals court, saying the laws passed by Congress sheilding federal workers from being fired encroached on the president's power.
          On April 7, 2025, another appeals court ruled 7-4 to reinstate the TRO requiring Harris to be reinstated, saying the previous appeal court ruling had ignored Supreme Court precedent on the issue.
          On April 9, 2025, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a stay on the TRO while they considered weather to block it.
          On May 22, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to pause the TRO, allowing Harris to be fired during the remainder of the legal process.
          The court said their ruling "reflects our judgment that the government is likely to show that both the NLRB and MSPB exercise considerable executive power" and "Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the president ... he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents."
          The exception they referred to was the Federal Reserve, saying that it is "a uniquely structured, quasi-private entity." 
          December 5: U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules 2-1 to remove Harris, saying federal laws allowing members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board to be removed only for cause violated the U.S. Constitution.

          Trump said the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 gives him the authority to end collective bargaining with federal unions to safeguard national security.
          Earlier in March, DHS ended a collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of TSA employees.

          The U.S. Department of Defense was called the War Department until 1949, when Congress consolidated the Army, Navy and Air Force in the wake of World War Two. 
          The name was chosen in part to signal that in the nuclear age, the U.S. was focused on preventing conflict.
          Changing the name again will be costly and require updating signs and letterheads used not only by officials at the Pentagon, but also military installations around the world.

          The shutdown threatened to halt the release of the September employment report, slow air travel, suspend scientific research, withhold pay from U.S. troops and lead to the furlough of 750,000 federal workers at a daily cost of $400 million.
          In an highly unusual overtly partisan move, the HUD displayed a message on their <a href="https://archive.ph/I126B" target="_blank">website</a> reading "The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need."

          October 31: two federal judges, Judge Indira Talwani in Boston and Judge John McConnell in Providence, ruled Trump must fund SNAP using $5.25 billion in contigency funding they had (SNAP is $8 billion per month) and their decision not to tap the funding was arbitrary.
          November 1: government stops funding SNAP benefits (41 million SNAP recipients) and most states do not cover the benefits themselves since the USDA said they won't be reimbursed (those filling funding are Delaware, New Mexico, Louisiana, Virginia and Vermont, and the District of Columbia).
          Judge McConnell says orders Trump to make full food aid benefit payments by 11/3, or partial payments by 11/5.

          Trump also partially funds SNAP using all the $5.25 billion in contingency funds, in line with McConnell's ruling, but warned it could take some states weeks or months to calculate and distribute the aid.
          November 6: Judge McConnell blocks Trumps partial funding plan and accuses him of withholding the benefits for "political reasons", orders him to fully fund SNAP by 11/7 for month of November by tapping a $23.35 billion fund derived from tariffs that has been used for WIC.
          November 7: 1st Circuit court declines to stay McConnell's order then hours later Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson issues stay, allowing Trump to withhold about $4 billion n SNAP benefits.
          Jackson said she stayed the order because she expected the 1st Circuit to rule on a permanent halt to McConnell's order quickly.
          November 9: USDA tells states to undo efforts to issue full food aid benefits, citing Supreme Court stay.
          November 10: 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejects Trump's bid to block MccConnels full funding order; U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston temporarily blocks USDA memo from day before on states undoing full funding.

            These engineers include Gavin Klinger, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine.  
            Gavin Klinger is a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Major grad from Berkeley in 2020, he was previously a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks, he also has a substack where he wrote an article "the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies"; Klinger was later found to have retweeted post from Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate in the past.  
            Luke Forritor is a former intern at SpaceX, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for rocket fuel parts, he graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a CS major, he was previously part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll.
            Edward Coristine is only a highschool grad having been enrolled at Northeastern University, he previously spent 3 weeks at Musk's Neuralink last summer, he also previously created 3 tech firms in Connecticut that are valued at $2.4 million by Zillow; it was later disclosed that Coristine had been fired from his previous job at Path Network amid a leaking investigation.

            He did not have a formal conversation with Trump before announcing his exit and his departure was decided "at a senior staff level."
            His exit came a day after he criticized Trump's tax bill, calling it too expensive and a measure that would undermine DOGE.

            The back-and-forth included Trump threatening to cut Tesla/SpaceX contracts (causing Tesla stock to drop 14%) and Musk calling for Trump's impeachment.
            According to WH sources, the breaking point was over personnel: Trump's decision to pull his nomination of Jared Isaacman, Musk's hand-picked candidate to be NASA administrator.

            On August 19, the WSJ reported that Musk is quietly putting the brakes on plans to start his new political party, telling allies he wants to focus on his companies.
            Musk, without commenting further on the report, said in an X post: "Nothing @WSJ says should ever be thought of as true".

            Trump's comments came after Musk said during a Tesla earnings call that U.S. government cuts in support for EV makers could lead to a "few rough quarters" for the company.

          On January 29, 2025, the White House offered 2 million federal full-time employees financial incentives to quit in a "deferred resignation program" to further shrink the government.
          The offer went to all employees except those in immigration, national security, or the US Postal Service, and warned that a majority of agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings and layoffs and that their jobs were not guaranteed.

          On June 13, Illston issued a TRO fully blocking the State Dept restructuring plan, saying their defense that the plan was made before the Feb RIF EO was false due to recent department documents citing the EO as a reason for the restructuring.

          On July 8, the Supreme Court lifted Illston's order (Jackson was only dissent), saying the Trump admin was "likely to succeed" in its argument that the mass layoffs were legally within his power. 
          The decision cleared one major legal obstacle for Trump but the court noted that it was not assessing the legality of any specific layoff plans at federal agencies and that they could still face legal challenges.

              The new layoffs brought the total reduction to around 3,000 including the voluntary departures, out of the 18,000 employees in the US.
              Trump's justification for the reduction was his "American First" vision, which included the elimination of top official for civilian security, democracy, and human rights and the closure of some offices that monitored war crimes and conflicts around the world.

              In late July, the U.S. Forest Service faced criticism from current and former employees who say the DOGE layoffs have left fire teams understaffed.
              Since Trump took office, 5,000 employees, roughly 15% of the USFS workforce, quit or were bought out.
              Brooke Rollins said that the agency was on target to hire 11,300 firefighters by mid July, outpacing hiring over the past three years.
              Some former and current USFS employees claim Trump administration workforce cuts have left firefighter support jobs understaffed, leaving firefighters performing non-firefighting duties like cleaning toilets and mowing lawns, while USFS officials maintain they have sufficient resources and are adequately prepared for the fire season.

          The emergency ruling came after DOGE gained access using armed police to the USIP, an independent, nonprofit organization funded by Congress.
          Howell strongly criticized how DOGE had entered the building but said she was not going issue a TRO.
          DOGE had a standoff on March 17 in which a handful of USIP staff locked the doors to the building, after which DOGE and the local police, expelled the USIP's president, several staffers, and an attorney from the building.
          Trump subsequently fired the USIP president and installed a loyalist to replace him.
          Trump had also previously fired most of the USIP board on March 14, which they claimed was unlawful due to Trump not giving a reason for the terminations.

          He later revised this to $1 tillion after Trump took office, then to $150 billion a few months into the presidency.
          At the end of May 2025 when Musk left, DOGE claimed $170 billion in savings on their "Wall of Receipts," but this number is disputed due to many of their receipts being riddled with errors.
          According to Treasury data from the time of Jan-May 2025, spent about $250 billion more than the same period the previous year, mostly due to the intrest on debt and Social Security increases.
          Among the agencies DOGE targeted including the State Dept, Dept of Education, USAID, NIH, and the CDC, Treasury data shows their spending was down $19 billion compared to the previous year.
          Also, the BBC did an analysis of the savings and could only verify $32.5 billion in savings due to the remainder of the claimed savings not having receipts attached. 
          CBS also reported that DOGE efforts so far have offsetting costs of $135 billion from rehiring mistakenly fired workers, layoff packages, lawsuits against DOGE, etc.

          Harvard has had longstanding links to China including research partnerships and China-focused academic centers, which have yielded major financial gifts, influence in international affairs and global prestige for the school.
          An example Republicans use of CCP-Harvard coordination is Harvard providing public health training to Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) officials after 2020, when the US sanctioned the Chinese paramilitary org for its role in alleged human rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the DHS says Harvard-XPCC have continued "as recently as 2024."

Chan, is a member of the Hong Kong based China-United States Exchange Foundation, which says its aim is to foster dialogue between the two countries, and has been classified as a foreign principal under US law, requiring U.S. lobbyists working for it to disclose that to the US government.

          She barred the administration from terminating or freezing any additional federal funding to Harvard and blocked it from continuing to withhold payment on existing grants or refusing to award new funding to the school in the future.

          December 4: ICE arrests visiting professor at Harvard Law School, Carlos Portugal Gouvea, after US revokes visa after he was charged with discharging a pellet gun outside a Massachusetts synagogue the day before Yom Kippur, which Trump's admin called an "anti-Semitic shooting incident".
          Gouvea said he was using a pellet gun to hunt rats nearby but he later agreed to leave the US and go back to Brazil.
          Despite the Trump admin's claims, the Temple Beth Zion said the incident did not appear to have been fueled by antisemitism, a view shared by the Brookline Police Department.
          The temple has said that police informed it that Gouvea was "unaware that he lived next to, and was shooting his BB gun next to, a synagogue or that it was a religious holiday."

          AP, citing editorial standards, said it would continue to use the gulf's established name.

          On April 15, Trump removed Bloomberg, Reuters, and the AP from their permanent slot in the WH press pool.
          The pool typically has 10 outlets, that follow the President wherever he goes but Trump is changing it to 30 rotating outlets determined by Karoline Leavitt.
          The three wire services were permanent slot holders due to local news outlets relying on their reporting, due to these local outlets not having a presence in Washington.
          The AP had previously been revomed from the pool due to the Gulf of America spat.

          On August 1, the nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting shut down its operations due to the loss of federal funding from the $9 billion recission package passed by Congress.
          This included the elimination of $1.1 billion earmarked for the CPB (which distributes funding to PBS and NPR) over the next two years.
          Created by the U.S. Congress in 1967, the CPB distributed more than $500 million annually to the PBS, NPR and more than 1,500 locally operated public radio and television stations.

          On April 29, Lamberth ordered Trump to restore $12 million in funding to Radio Free Europe, saying Congress having funding powers.
          Lamberth said Trump should not have signed the continuing resolution in Mar 2025 that included Global media funding if he wanted to cut it.
          On May 3, an appeals court ruled 2-1 to block Lamberth's order on VOA workers return and funding restore for Radio Free Asia, saying that Lamberth didn't have the jurisdiction.
          On September 29, Lamberth orderd Trump to halt his plan to fire 532 remaining employees from VOA parent U.S. Agency for Global Media and while he determines if the Trump admin complied with his April injunction.

                Paramount said the money would go to Trump's presidential library.

          The Times said Trump's lawsuit has no legitimate legal claims and is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.
          Penguin Random House called Trump's lawsuit meritless and said it stands by the book and its authors.

          The cuts were authored by Tarak Makecha, a former Tesla employee, who created the list without consulting program managers at the department's Office of Justice Programs.
          Bondi said the cuts reflected the priorities of Trump.
          DOJ grants typically run for 3 years and grant focuses often change from admin to admin, however, grants are rarely cut outright.
          A day after some Reuters reported on the cuts, seven of them were restored including for a program for pet-friendly domestic violence shelters.
          One terminated grant that wasn't restored was $8.3 million to the National Policing Institute, which funded rural police departments and district attorneys' offices to help pay for automated license plate readers, violent crime investigators, investigations against drug dealers for fentanyl overdoses, and programs to combat child sexual abuse.
          Bondi later tweeted examples of "wasteful grants," including a $2 million to "national listening sessions of individuals with lived experience," DOGE quote tweeted with "Great work."
          That $2 million grant trained prosecutors to investigate child abuse in juvenile detention facilities, youth correctional facilities or group homes; the listening sessions allowed prosecutors to hear directly from youth abuse victims.

          Of the 145 community violence intervention (CVI) grants totaling more than $300 million awarded through the DOJ, 69 grants were abruptly terminated in April.
          Some critics of CVI argue that the programs aren't effective and that the funding should go to better law enforcement while others view the initiatives as inherently "anti-gun" and are used by NGOs to advocate against gun rights.
          However, in June, a letter signed by 18 law enforcement groups and police chiefs in Louisville, Minneapolis, Tucson and Omaha called on Bondi to reinstate funding that has resulted in "measurable and significant reductions in violence and homicides."

          Presidents have issued EOs related to HBCUs, with variations in title and scope, since President Jimmy Carter began formally centering HBCUs in federal policy in 1980.
          However, Trump's EO lacked a commitment to new federal funding, compared to Biden's pairing his 2021 executive order with nearly $1.6 billion in funding announced within a week of the executive order. 
          Trump later released a fact sheet refrerring to HBCU-related funding from his first term.
          Between 2021 and 2024, Biden directed $17 billion, including $1.3 billion in 2024 alone.
          As of 2025, many HBCUs still struggle with inadequate infrastructure, lower faculty pay, and limited state investment, especially compared to nearby HWIs.

          Young said he had in four decades on the bench "never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable."

          On August 21, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 (Roberts joined liberals) to overturn Young's ruling, allowing Trump to proceed with NIH DEI cuts.
          The majority suggested the challenge to the terminations should have been brought in a different judicial body, the Washington-based Court of Federal Claims, which specializes in money damages claims against the U.S. government. 
          However, also by a 5-4 majority, declined the administration's request to immediately pause Young's broader ruling that declared the agency's internal guidance explaining the rejection of funding for DEI and gender identity research as unlawful.

          Smith said the TRO is not needed since the NEA had already reversed their policy to withold funding after the ACLU filed their lawsuit.

          After the lawsuit was filed, the NEA rescinded its initial policy and on April 30 re-implemented Trump's order through a new one under which the NEA's chair would assess grants "for artistic excellence and merit, including whether the proposed project promotes gender ideology," on a "case-by-case" basis.
          While a project deemed to promote "gender ideology" would not be denied funding solely on that basis, that determination could weigh against whether it receives final approval.

          The new company was expected to be valued at $14M, far below estimates.
          Trump said Michael Dell (Dell founder), Rupert Murdoch (Fox News owner), and "probably four or five absolutely world-class investors" would be part of the deal.
          Other sources said Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake would take a 50% stake while existing shareholders in ByteDance (Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR) would hold a 30% stake.

        <li><u>Artificial Intelligence Policy</u>
          In January 2025 Trump signed an EO directing the establishment of an AI plan and in July he signed a series of EO's that outlined his AI strategy, with the main issue being the AI arms race with China.
          Trump's AI policy shifted from the Biden's approach of considering environmental and equity constraints in favor of a deregulation that only worries about speed.
          Trump's AI policy also marked departure from Biden's "high fence" approach that limited global access to coveted AI chips.
          The AI plan did not address national security concerns around Nvidia's H20 chip, which Trump blocked the export of in April before backtracking in early July.

        <li><u>DOD Software Cancellation</u>
          On August 13, 2025, Navy and Air Force cancelled two nearly complete software projects that took 12 years and well over $800 million combined to develop.
          The reason for the unusual move: officials at those departments, who have so far put the existing projects on hold, want other firms, including Salesforce and billionaire Peter Thiel's Palantir, to have a chance to win similar projects, which could amount to a costly do-over.
          In 2019, Accenture said it had won a contract to expand an HR platform to modernize HR functions for the Air Force with Oracle software.
          The project, which includes other vendors and was later expanded to include Space Force, grew to cost $368 million and was scheduled for its first deployment in summer 2025 at the Air Force Academy.
          An April "status update" on the project conducted by the Air Force described the project as "on track," with initial deployment scheduled for June, noting that it would end up saving the Air Force $39 million annually by allowing it to stop using an older system.
          But on May 30, Darlene Costello, then-Acting assistant Secretary of the Air Force, sent out a memo placing a "strategic pause" on the project for ninety days and calling for the study of alternate technical solutions.

        <li><u>Nippon Steel</u>
          On June 12, 2025, Trump made a deal with Nippon Steel to sell US Steel to them with the US having a "golden share."
          The golden share meant that Americans would have a 51% share in ownership of the steelmaker.
          The deal was part of an agreement for Japan's Nippon Steel to buy US Steel for $14.9-billion, capping off a tumultuous 18-month effort.
          Lutnick said the share would prevent the companies from reducing or delaying $14 billion in promised investments, transferring production or jobs outside the US, or closing or idling plants before certain time frames, without the president's consent.
          The share also gives Trump veto power over a potential relocation of U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, a transfer of jobs overseas, a name change, as well as other protections relating to "employee salaries, anti-dumping pricing, raw materials and sourcing outside the U.S., acquisitions, and more."
          However, analysts said that the golden share approach is both risky and unprecedented and would make foreign investors wary due to government control in corporate decisions.

          Cadence was run for over a decade by Lip-Bu Tan, a Malaysian-born Chinese American business executive appointed chief executive of Intel in March. 
          Tan was CEO of Cadence from 2008 through December 2021, which includes the period the illegal Chinese sales took place, and was executive chairman until May 2023.

          Tan previously invested at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military.

          On August 18, the Trump admin said it would discuss taking a 10% stake in Intel that would involve converting some or all of the company's grants from the U.S. Chips and Science Act into equity.
          Some analysts said this could give Intel much-needed breathing room and boost investor confidence; others warn it doesn't fix Intel's deeper issues—like a thin product roadmap, lagging process quality (problems with 18A), and challenges in attracting external foundry customers.
          Risks with the deal are the politicization of corporate decisions, potential mandates favoring Intel for strategic rather than performance-driven reasons, and the danger of undermining industry competitiveness.

          On August 22, Trump said the U.S. would take a 10% stake in Intel under a deal that converts CHIPS Act grants into an equity share.
          Under the agreement, the U.S. will purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion, or $20.47 per share, which represents a discount of about $4 from Intel's current share price of $24.80.
          The purchase of the 433.3 million Intel shares will be made with funding from the $5.7 billion in unpaid CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion awarded to Intel for the Biden-era Secure Enclave program.
          The government's $8.9 billion investment is in addition to the $2.2 billion in grants Intel has received to date, making for a total investment of $11.1 billion.
          The government's stake is to be passive ownership and does not include a board seat, with the government agreeing to vote with the company's board on matters that need shareholder approval.
          The equity stake also includes a five-year warrant at $20 a share for an additional 5% of Intel stock, which the U.S. can use if Intel loses control of the foundry business.
          Analysts were skeptical on if the deal could save Intel, whih Intel needing external customers for its 18A and 14A manufacturing process, something government cash infusions has not effect on.

          As part of the new deal, Intel issued the U.S. government 274.6 million shares and promised the government the option to buy up to 240.5 million more shares under certain conditions.
          Intel also put 158.7 million shares in an escrow account to be released after the government makes available more CHIPS funds for the Secure Enclave program.

          Historically, the U.S. government made decisions to control the export of sensitive technologies on national security grounds, with those decisions viewed as non-negotiable; if a technology was controlled, companies could not buy their way around those controls, no matter how lucrative the foregone foreign sales.
          He also made a similar deal with Nvidia's smaller rival AMD.
          Months earlier, Trump had banned the sale of H20 chips to China, reversing the decision in July as part of what the government said were negotiations on rare earths.

          Trump claimed that H20 was obsolete, with it not being very good at AI training, however, it is one of the leaders in AI inference and far ahead of the current AI chips China has access to.

          On February 14, 2025, the Dept of Education sent out a memo ordering the agency to withhold funding from schools that teach lessons about systemic racism and other so-called DEI topics and in April 2025 they ordered all public schools to end any DEI policies or lose funding.
          On February 25, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association sued Trump, seeking to block the DoE memo.

          On March 21, Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to have the TRO paused and directed the DOE to restore the $600 mln in grants.

          According to the memo, despite the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court affirmative action ruling, universities have skirted the decision by relying on "diversity statements" students provide in applying that indicate their race and the White House now wants schools to show they are complying.

            A week after the order, Marco Rubio issued a waiver for live-saving humanitarian assistance during the 90 day pause, despite the waiver, numerous cases of life-saving aid not being delivered remained, due to a breakdown in communication at USAID from Trump's overhaul.
            Many aid workers erred on the side of caution and closed their aid programs since the US government became unresponsive to them in weather their programs qualified as "life-saving."

          On February 13, 2025, a US District Judge Amir Ali, ordered Trump to restore funding for hundreds of foreign aid contractors.
          The lawsuit was brought by two aid organizations that receive funding from the US government, they argued that Trump's rationale for the freeze, which was to review all aid programs, was not a necessary presursor to achieve his goal.

          The appeal said that the delay in unfreezing was due to a new approval process the Trump admin was using to ensure payments aligned with Trump's agenda, which Ali already ruled was an invalid reason for delaying the payments.

          On August 13, in a 2-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said Judge Ali erred by ordering the Trump admin to restore foreign assistance payments previously approved by Congress and lifted his injunction.

          The order came a week after Trump's attempt at a pocket rescission to cut USAID funding.
          Ali said the appeals court left open the ability for the plaintiffs to argue the administration's unilateral decision not to spend funds as Congress directed violated the Administrative Procedure Act.

        <li><u>2024 Human Rights Report</u>
          On August 12, 2025, the Trump admin released the widely anticipated 2024 Human Rights Report of the U.S. State Department, dramatically softening criticism of some countries such as El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have extensive records of abuses.
          Instead, the report sounded an alarm on the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa
          Any criticism of governments over their treatment of LGBTQI rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appeared to have been largely omitted.
          Washington referred to Russia's invasion of Ukraine mainly as the "Russia-Ukraine war."
          The report's section on Israel was much shorter than last year's edition and contained no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza.
          "There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses," the 2024 report said about El Salvador.
          That stood in sharp contrast to the 2023 report that talked about "significant human rights issues" and listed them as credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.
          In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the State Department found the human rights situation declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes.
          In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year's report said the human rights situation significantly worsened.
          In 2023's report, the State Department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.

          The money at issue was earmarked for foreign aid, United Nations peacekeeping operations, and democracy-promotion efforts overseas.
          Budget director Russell Vought argued that Trump can withhold funds for 45 days, which would run out the clock until the end of the fiscal year on September 30, a tactic last used in 1977.

          The epicenter of the flooding was in Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, where 68 of the deaths were.
          The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on July 4.
          Officials said on July 5 that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees.
          On July 6, FEMA was deployed after Trump issued a major disaster declaration.
          DHS Secretary Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a "moderate" flood watch issued on July 3 by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall.
          The floods caused questioning over if Trump's thousands of job cuts at NOAA, the National Weather Service's parent agency, which left many weather offices understaffed, led to the inaccurate rainfall prediction.

          On August 4, 2025, the Trump admin began requiring states and cities to certify that they will not cut off "commercial relations specifically with Israeli companies" to receive the money from FEMA.

          In 2018, during Trump's first term, he created the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program to help state and local governments protect major infrastructure such as roads and bridges before the occurrence of floods, hurricanes, and natural disasters.
          In April, 2025, the Trump admin announced it would end the BRIC program calling it wasteful, effective, and politicized.
          In response, 20 mostly Democratic led states sued Trump, saying FEMA had approved about $4.5 billion in grants for nearly 2000 projects and that FEMA lacked the power to cancel the BRIC program without congressional approval.
          On August 5, U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston issued a preliminary injunction preventing the government from spending money allocated to the BRIC program for other purposes, saying there was an inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law, and the potential hardship to states from the funds being repurposed far outweighed the minimal hardship to the government.

          Kennedy said the child who died in April died from "a bacteriological infection" but not measles, a common anti-vax tactic, despite Texas health officials saying measles was the cause.
          Kennedy responded by saying outbreaks were not "unusual" and that there were 16 in 2024, rather than emphasizing the need for vaccination, Kennedy later went on to endorse the vaccine as the best way to prevent measles while still advocating for alt-treatments as well.

          Despite the outbreak, on Mar 11, 2025, RFK Jr went on Hannity and said the MMR vaccine causes "deaths every year," despite there being no recorded deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people.
          Later in April 2025, RFK Jr said that measles is always going to be around since the MMR vaccine wanes quickly, despite the MMR vaccine having 97% lifetime effectiveness after 2 doses.
          In 1963 before the vaccine there were 3-4 million measles cases a year, not it is usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.
          High vaccination rates are important because when 95% of people are vaccinated then the community has herd immunity, which protects people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.

        <li><u>Autism</u> 
            RFK Jr has claimed that autism is an "epidemic" and that we know that it is caused by "environmental exposure."
            <sup><a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
            Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
            In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
            No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
            Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
            Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
            Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/why-are-autism-rates-rising-2025-01-14/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            Despite Kennedy saying they would go after autism, during the first 4 months of 2025, has reduced funding for autism-related research by an estimated $31 million to $116 million from $147 million in the same period in 2024.
            The funding cuts came because they involved diverse populations, studied differences in gender or took place at research universities currently under scrutiny by the Trump Admin.

            On September 22, Trump held a press conference with Kennedy where they, where Trump claimed that autism was caused by the MMR vaccine and by pregnant woman using Tylenol.
            Trump's advice goes against that of medical societies, which cite data from numerous studies showing that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, plays a safe role in the well-being of pregnant women.
            Researchers say there is no firm evidence of a link between the use of Tylenol and autism, with a 2024 study of nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden finding no causal link between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders.
            A 2025 review of 46 earlier studies, which Kennedy cited in the conference, did suggest a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of these conditions, but the researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Harvard University and others said the study does not prove the drug caused the outcomes.
            They advised that pregnant women should continue to use acetaminophen as needed, at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible period. 
            Trump's team also suggested leucovorin, a form of folic acid, as a treatment for autism symptoms, running counter to dozens of medical, research, and autism advocacy groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who decried the president's announcement.
            Researchers say leucovorin, used to treat some cancer patients on chemotherapy, has shown some promise in very small trials, but that large, randomized trials are still needed.
            The FDA approved a version of leucovorin for treating autism and said it would be covered by Medicaid.
            The FDA, in its approval process, cited a review of the use of leucovorin in 40 patients with a rare metabolic disorder called cerebral folate deficiency that can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, some of which are seen in people with autism.
            Trump also called for the removal of mercury from vaccines, said children should not get the hepatitis B vaccine before the age of 12 (normally given in the first 24 hours after birth), and said the MMR vaccine should be split into three different parts.

            6 of the fired panel members got $80 or less from drugmakers from 2017-2023, 7 other members got $4000-55000 from drugmakers, and 3 others didn't have their payments tracked.
            ACIP members must divest all vaccines stock and stop vaccine consulting, can't accept travel/food from vaccine companies, must recuse themselves of conflicst arise, but can still work on RCTs funded by vaccine makers.
            On August 18, new study published in JAMA contradicted Kennedy, finding that between 2000 and 2024, ACIP's annual reported conflict of interest rate declined from 42.8% to 5%.

          In May 2025, the MAHA commission released a highly-publicized report on the health of American children.
          The report said processed food, chemicals, stress and overprescription of medications, and vaccines may be factors behind chronic illness in American children, citing some 500 research studies.
          The report was found to include 7 studies that didn't exist and misstated conclusions from some studies, both of which the Trump admin said were just "formatting issues."
          The errors and speed at which the report was produced suggest that the MAHA Commission produced it using ChatGPT.

          That report linked processed foods and over-prescription of medications and vaccines to rising rates of childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, and ADHD.
          It notably stops short of recommending changes to U.S. agrochemical regulatory processes, a key demand of some MAHA activists.

          On May 20, 2025, the FDA announced they were requiring new clinical trials for approval of annual COVID-19 boosters for healthy Americans under age 65, effectively limiting them to older adults.
          FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and top U.S. vaccines regulator Vinay Prasad claimed that the benefit of repeated annual shots for healthy adults was uncertain after several years of the virus circulating and vaccines being available.
          Makary and Prasad said the FDA will approve the boosters for adults 65+ years old based on data from immune response testing, the shots will also be available for everyone 6+ months old with one or more high risk severe COVID-19 outcomes.
          However, for healthy people between the ages of six months and 64 years, the FDA will require placebo-controlled clinical trials for approval for annual shots.
          Prasad also said new trials will be necessary every year, just when there are major shifts in the virus.
          Vaccine makers are unlikely to conduct the clinical trials since they would require large enrollment and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

          On August 20, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all young children aged 6-23 months get vaccinated against COVID-19, differing from the new CDC guidelines.
          On August 28, CVS Health's insurer Aetna said that that despite the change in CDC recommendations, that for plans it operates and funds, the company will continue to provide coverage for COVID vaccines with no cost sharing.

          On August 6, Kennedy announced 22 projects, totaling $500 million, to develop vaccines using mRNA technology will be halted.
          "To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we're prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don't collapse when viruses mutate,"" Kennedy said.
          "I don't think I've seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business," said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations, noting that mRNA technology offers potential advantages of rapid production, crucial in the event of a new pandemic that requires a new vaccine.
          According to experts, Kennedy's claims ignore how mRNA vaccines work, where he's misguided is that vaccines aim to prevent severe infection and death, not to completely protect from infection in the first place.

          The website previously said "studies have shown there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder."
          The page kept the header "Vaccines do not cause autism," saying that it has not been removed due to an agreement with Senator Bill Cassidy, who Kennedy secured an endorsement from, in part by pledging that he would not change the CDC's website language on vaccines and autism.

          On August 24, 2025, the HHS reported the first human case in the United States of travel-associated New World screwworm.
          The case was originally identified on August 4 in a patient who returned from travel to El Salvador.
          Beef industry sources said the week before that the CDC had confirmed a human case of screwworm in Maryland from someone who had traveled from Guatemala.
          Screwworms are parasitic flies whose females lay eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal. 
          Once the eggs hatch, hundreds of screwworm larvae use their sharp mouths to burrow through living flesh, eventually killing their host if left untreated.
          In June, USDA head Brooke Rollins announced plans for a sterile fly facility at Moore Air Force Base in Edinburg, Texas, saying it would take two to three years to come online.
          Screwworms have been traveling north through Mexico from Central America since 2023 and are endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and countries in South America.
          In July, Mexico reported a new case close to the border upon which the USDA immediately ordered the closure of livestock trade through southern ports of entry, after previously halting imports in November 2024 and May 2025.

          Monarez's attorneys accused Kennedy of targeting her for refusing to support "unscientific directives" and dismiss health experts, she said Kennedy clashed with her over her refusal to rubber stamp ACIP recommendations.
          The same day, four senior officials resigned over vaccine policy, misinformation, and public health weaponization.
          The officials included Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Demetre Daskalakis and National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Director Daniel Jernigan.
          Following Monarez' firing, Kennedy faced increasing pressure from both sides of the political spectrum, with some Democrats calling for his resignation.
          In a Senate hearing in September, Monarez provided details of the exchange she had with Kennedy before she was fired. 
          On August 25, Kennedy told her that "the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing certainly in September," and Kennedy asked her to commit to approving changes to the vaccine schedule before reviewing scientific evidence.
          Kennedy also directed her to commit in advance to approve every ACIP recommendation, regardless of the scientific evidence, to fire CDC officials responsible for vaccine policy, and he also told her not to speak with U.S. Senators.

          On February 10, 2025, Bove directed federal prosecutors to drop all corruption charges on NY Mayor Eric Adams, saying the case was impeding his ability to aid Trump on immigration.
          Bove said he didn't question the integrity of the prosecutors who brought the case and had no doubts on the merit of it but said he endorsed the idea that the charges were only brought on Adams because he critisiced Biden's immigration policy.
          Bove said he wanted the charges dropped "without prejudice," so that they could possibly be revived again after the upcoming NY mayoral election amounting to an implicit threat of future prosecution if Adams didn't play ball.
          Adams was federally indicted (means he most likely is guilty) in Sept 2024 for accepting bribes from Turkish officials in exchange for taking pro-Turkey actions.
          Following Adams' indictment, he began forging ties with Trump, inlcuding attending his inaguration at Maralago, leading many to believe he was seeking a pardon.

          On February 13, in the first large controntation in the new Trump presidency, the Manhattan US Attorney, Dannielle Sassoon resigned after rejecting to comply with Bove's order to drop charges on Adams.
          After Sassoon had rejected dismissing the case, Trump's admin directed John Keller, the acting head of the Justice Department's public corruption unit, to do so.
          However, Keller also resigned along with Kevin Driscoll, a senior official in the department's criminal division, three other deputies in the DOJ public corruption unit also resigned.
          Sassoon was picked by Trump to temporarily lead the office prosecuting Adams, she is also a member of the right-leaning Federalist Society and a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
          Sassoon also said she would seek a new indictment accusing Adams of destroying evidence and directing others to do so.
          Bove responded by saying that Sassoon had failed to comply with what he called his office's finding that the case against Adams amounted to "weaponization" of the justice system, saying the DOJ would "not tolerate the insubordination."
          Bove said that the two trial prosecutors on Adam's case would be put on leave and his office would take over the case, moving to dismiss it.
          In a letter to Bondi, Sassoon wrote that she and Bove attended a meeting on Jan 31 in which Adams' lawyers said they mayor could only enforce immigration policies if his charges were dropped, Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, denied any "quid pro quo." 
          The resignations were compared to the "Saturday Night Massacre" in 1973, when senior DOJ officials resigned after refusing Nixon's order to fire the special counsel investigating break-in at the Watergate Democratic headquarters.

          In light of the EO, Trump's admin pushed to halt anti-corruption efforts in the government.
          This included disbanding the task force responsible for sanctioning Russian oligarchs, firing DOJ officials who prosecuted Trump, firing 17 investigator generals, firing the head of the whistleblowers office, and calling for corruption charges on NY Mayor Adams to be dropped.
          Trump's DOJ also dropped charges on Republican congressman, Jeff Fortenberry, who had been awaiting trial on charges accusing him of lying to the FBI, as well as the 2 Trump aids charges along Trump in his documents case.
          The moves showed Trump's willingness to break from having an apolitical justice system in favor of aligning the DOJ with Trump's political agenda.

        <li><u>Reversing Biden Consumer Protections</u>
          On August 13, 2025, Trump revoked Biden executive order 14036 "Promoting Competition in the American Economy" that aimed to promote more competition in the U.S. economy as part of a broad push to rein in what his administration described as a pattern of corporate abuses, ranging from excessive airline fees to large mergers that raised costs for consumers.

          On September 4 (formally on November 14), Trump dropped a Biden plan to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when U.S. flight disruptions are caused by carriers.
          In December 2024, Biden sought public comment on the rulemaking process about whether airlines should be required to pay $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays. 
          U.S. airlines sharply criticized the proposal first made by Biden in May 2023, saying it would only raise ticket prices.
          The Biden admin said the rule "would not only have put real cash back in your hands for badly delayed or canceled flights, but would have resulted in far fewer delayed and canceled flights in the first place."
          Major U.S. carriers in 2022 committed to paying for meals, hotel stays, and other expenses when they cause significant flight disruptions.
          Airlines in the U.S. must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. 
          The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules.

          World Liberty lists Eric Trump, Donald Jr. and Barron Trump, as co-founders.
          It also issues a dollar-backed stablecoin, called USD1.
          In the run-up to his inauguration in January, Trump and First Lady Melania Trump launched memecoins $TRUMP and $MELANIA, which have since slumped to $1.7 billion and $144 million, respectively from $9 billion and $1.6 billion shortly after launch.

          On September 21, 2025, it was reported that Trump's border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent as part of a sting operation on Homan.
          In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the new Trump administration in exchange for the money.
          The probe into Homan started around August 2024, near the end of Biden's term, and stemmed from a separate unrelated national security probe where the target repeatedly brought up Homan, saying he was collecting bribes in exchange for future government contracts.
          FBI Director Kash Patel ordered the investigation closed over the summer, saying there was no evidence Homan had committed a crime and that the investigation was a "blatantly political investigation".
          Homan was an official at ICE under Obama and its acting director during Trump's first term but served in the private sector during Biden's term.
          WH Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said they rejected the reporting that Homan accepted any such payment and said they backed him "100% because he did absolutely nothing wrong."

        <li><u>Mark Zarkin</u>
          November 7, 2025: Reuters reports that FHFA director Bill Pulte (originator of fraud allegations against Letitia James and others), appointed Mark Zarkin, a Michigan restaurateur and prominent Detroit-area Trump supporter, as a consultant to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae in March 2025.
          Zarkin's pleaded no contest to an attempted third-degree sexual conduct charge in Macomb County, Michigan, in 1999, following an investigation that found Zarkin's DNA during a "pelvic examination" of a woman, not yet of drinking age, who had been "mentally incapacitated" by alcohol and Valium. 
          In 2000, Zarkin was sentenced to eight months in jail and three years' probation, and ordered to register as a sex offender.
          Zarkin served his sentence and spent nine years on the sex-offender registry until Zarkin's lawyer successfully petitioned the state court to vacate the conviction, arguing that his continued listing on the sex registry was excessive and when he agreed to his plea deal he didn't realize he would remain on the registry for so long. 
          Registering as an offender was an explicit part of Zarkin's plea agreement and 2009 court order vacating the conviction gave no reason for the unusual decision.
          Zarkin was also involved in an ongoing Michigan lawsuit alleging that Zarkin held conversations with Jamiel Altaheri, former police chief in Hamtramck (in Detroit), where the two men discussed a plan to pay Trump as much as $5 million to secure a pardon for an unidentified New York acquaintance of Altaheri accused of unspecified financial crimes.

          On August 26, U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen threw out an unusual lawsuit the Trump administration filed against every federal judge in Maryland over an order slowing down speedy deportation efforts.
          The DOJ filed the case in June after the Maryland court in May adopted a standing order that automatically blocks for two business days the deportation of migrants in the state who file new habeas lawsuits challenging their detention.
          Cullen said the judges are "immune from suit," and that Trump "fails to identify a legitimate cause of action that allows it to bring this lawsuit."
          Cullen, whom Trump appointed in 2020, also wrote that it was unfortunate that the Trump admin used words like "rogue," "unhinged," and "radical" to describe federal judges across the country.

                The charges breached decades-long norms that have sought to insulate U.S. law enforcement from political pressures, coming days after Trump pressured the DOJ to prosecute Comey and other critics.
                The indictment alleges that Comey misled Congress by claiming he had not authorized anyone else to be an anonymous source in news reporting about an FBI investigation.
                The week prior, the prosecutor in the case, Erik Siebert, resigned and others in the office told his successor, former Trump personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan, not to pursue the charges due to lack of evidence.

                U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick finds that Lindsey Halligan may have made significant legal errors in presenting evidence and instructing grand jurors who were weighing whether to charge Comey - mistakes that could have tainted the case.
                Fitzpatrick said he would order prosecutors to turn over grand jury materials to Comey's defense for use in a potential future legal motion to have the charges dismissed.
                Grand jury materials are typically protected by strict secrecy rules and Fitzpatrick acknowledged that disclosure to the defense was an "extraordinary remedy," but found that Comey had shown a specific need for the records.
                Fitzpatrick's ruling describes multiple investigative blunders in the investigation including prosecutors' decision to review evidence the FBI seized years earlier without securing a new warrant and allowing an FBI agent to testify to the grand jury even though the agent may have been exposed to material shielded by attorney-client privilege as well as Halligan making statements to grand jurors harmful to Comey's legal rights.

          The lawsuit alleged that FBI Director Kash Patel said "The FBI tried to put the president in jail and he hasn't forgotten it," before ordering the firing of anyone who had worked on a criminal investigation against President Trump, and that Driscoll's own job depended on their removal.
          Driscoll temporarily served as the FBI's director early in 2025, and sought to shield FBI employees who had been investigating January 6.
          Driscoll is widely seen by rank and file agents as a hero who pushed back against the DOJ efforts target people who worked on January 6 investigations.
          Driscoll alleged that while he was being vetted ahead of Trump's inauguration, he was asked by White House staffer, Paul Ingrassia, about "when did you start supporting President Trump" and whether he had voted for Democratic candidates in the last five elections, questions he refused to answer.
          Driscoll said he was told later that evening by Emil Bove that he had "failed" the vetting interview and that Ingrassia had reported that he was not "based out" enough - a term he understood to mean loyalty to Trump's political ideology.
          However, Driscoll was still allowed to temporarily serve as deputy acting FBI director during the transition, upon which Driscoll alleged that Bove said he was under pressure from Stephen Miller to see "symmetrical action at the FBI as had been happening at DOJ," in a reference to the firings of officials involved in Trump-related cases.
          Shortly after, Bove asked for the names of FBI employees who worked in the Washington, Miami and Las Vegas offices, as well as those who worked on the January 6 investigations, which Driscoll resisted, causing Bove to accuse Driscoll of insubordination.
          When Driscoll and Robert Kissane (acting FBI director at the time) told Bove that employees were feeling anxiety from the pressure campaign, Bove said that "was the intent."

          Some of the most consequential reporting in U.S. history — from Watergate to warrantless wiretapping after 9/11 — was and continues to be made possible because reporters have been able to protect the identities of confidential sources.

          Siebert previously expressed doubts about the strength of the case.
          Trump said he had soured on Siebert after learning that Virginia's two Democratic U.S. senators supported his nomination.
          Siebert's office has also been involved in a separate criminal investigation of former FBI Director James Comey, another case Siebert felt had weak evidence.

          On September 20, Trump appointed his former attorney from his Mar-a-Lago documents case, Lindsey Halligan, to replace Siebert.
          The appointment came hours after Trump pressured Bondi to pursue his political opponents more aggressively, saying "We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW."

          October 9: grand jury indicts James with DOJ charges including one count of bank fraud and one count of making a false statement to a lending institution.
          The indictment accuses James of falsely telling a bank that she would occupy a Virginia home she bought in 2020 for around $137,000 as a secondary residence but then used it as an investment property.
          The DOJ said the alleged misrepresentation allowed James to receive a favorable interest rate, saving her around $19,000 over the life of the loan.
          Both charges require prosecutors to prove that James had criminal intent, meaning she knowingly provided false information to secure a financial benefit.
          The property referenced in the indictment was different from the home that FHFA Director Pulte sent the DOJ in April.

          Bolton was given a protective Secret Service detail after Iran threatened to assassinate him.

          Bolton served as the UN ambassador and as national security adviser during Trump's first term but has since become a critic of Trump, calling him unfit to serve and writing a scathing book about his time in Trump's first term.
          A judge rejected the administration's bid to block publication of the book in 2020 and both the criminal investigation and lawsuit were dropped in 2021 by Biden.
          On August 22, FBI agents raided Bolton's home, as part of a probe ordered by Kash Patel focused on the potential criminal release of classified information.
          Bolton responded, "Donald Trump's Ukraine policy today is no more coherent than it was last Friday when his administration executed search warrants against my home and office. Collapsing in confusion and haste, Trump's negotiations may be in their last throes, along with his Nobel Peace Prize campaign."

          Indictment alleged Bolton shared sensitive info with two relatives (wife and daughter) for possible use in his book, including notes on intelligence briefings and meetings with senior government officials and foreign leaders.
          The Bolton investigation was opened in 2022 and the case is viewed as stronger than the prosecutions of Comey and James.

          The DOJ previously maneuvered to keep Habba in her post and circumvent a judicial decision not to extend her 120-day interim tenure.
          The DOJ fired Desiree Grace, a career prosecutor who was selected by the court to replace Habba, and the White House said Trump preemptively removed her as U.S. attorney.
          The department is using similar tactics to evade judicial intervention and temporarily keep at least three other U.S. attorneys aligned with Trump in their roles.

          With the EO, Trump showed he was done waiting for Congress to pass the SAVE Act, which would do the same thing as Trump's EO but be codified.
          The EO has the possibility of disenfranchising voters, with 9% of Americans (21 mln people) not having proof of citizenship readily available.

          On August 3, 2025, Texas Democratic lawmakers left the state in order to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts.
          Trump championed the redistricting plan that was expected to yield as many as five additional House Republicans in the 2026 midterms, at the time Republicans held a narrow 220-212 majority in the house with three Democratic held seats vacant from Texas following one member's death.
          States are required to redistrict every 10 years based on the U.S. Census but the Texas map was passed just four years ago by the Republican-dominated legislature. 
          While mid-cycle redistricting occasionally takes place, it is usually prompted by a change in power at the legislature.

          On August 18, the Texas Democratic lawmakers returned to the state, ending a two-week walkout that broke quorum.
          Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu, said Democrats returned because they had achieved their two main goals: (1) to block a vote on new congressional maps in the first special legislative session and (2) to prompt California and other Democratic-led states to consider redrawing their own maps.
          Other Republican states including Ohio, Florida, Indiana and Missouri were also moving forward with or considering their own redistricting efforts, as were Democratic states such as Maryland and Illinois.
          After they returned to the statehouse, the Republicans assigned state law enforcement officers to monitor the Democrats' movement.
          Democratic state Representative Nicole Collier spent the night in the Texas Capitol building rather than agree to a police monitor.

        <li><u>Nevada Voter Fraud Conspiracy</u>
          On September 30, Nevada Acting U.S. Attorney, Sigal Chattah, revealed she asked the FBI to investigate Republican claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election, a probe she hopes will influence congressional races and ensnare Democrats.
          She said she gave investigators a thumb drive containing data compiled by Nevada's Republican Party about people living in the U.S. illegally who cast ballots in the 2020 election and members of Indian tribes who allegedly received cash for ballots, and also urged the agents to call the state's Republican Party attorney.
          Chattah said her goal was to remove "illegal aliens" from voter rolls, possibly leading to "reallocation of census numbers" and affect the race for Nevada's 4th congressional district seat, and also wants to exonerate the six Republicans who were prosecuted by Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford for posing as fake electors for Trump in 2020.
          Chattah has multiple conflicts of interest that potentially violate ethics rules including her prior work as an attorney representing certain Republican clients and as Nevada's RNC chairwoman.
          Impartiality rules also generally prohibit government lawyers from working for a year on any matter involving a former employer or legal client.
          In 2020, Chattah echoed Trump's false election fraud claims but the Nevada Republican Party tried in 2021 to present evidence of voter fraud to the state, but the state concluded that most of the complaints related to voter registration records were "inaccurate or suspicious for a variety of reasons."

          However, also on September 30, U.S. District Judge David Campbell found that Chattah is not validly serving as acting U.S. Attorney and therefore "her involvement in these cases would be unlawful," referring to four criminal cases she was leading.
          Chattah was appointed in late March to serve a 120-day stint as interim U.S. attorney but when her appointment was about to expire on July 26, the Trump admin extended her appointment under a different federal law, making her acting U.S. attorney, a move that effectively front-ran the U.S. District Court from being able to appoint someone to serve in the role.

        <li><u>Epstein Files</u>
          In February 2025, far-right twitter influencers were invited to the White House and provided with binders marked "The Epstein Files: Phase 1" and "Declassified" that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain, leading to internet backlash.
          After the release flopped, in a March TV interview, Bondi claimed the Biden administration "sat on these documents, no one did anything with them," adding: "Sadly these people don't believe in transparency, but I think more unfortunately, I think a lot of them don't believe in honesty."
          On July 7, the DOJ said Epstein didn't have a client list and that no more files related to the wealthy financier's sex trafficking investigation would be made public despite promises from Attorney General Pam Bondi that had raised the expectations of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.
          Bondi suggesting in a Fox News interview earlier that year that such a document was "sitting on my desk" for review.
          FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino have also insisted in television and podcast interviews that the evidence was clear that Epstein had killed himself.
          They also released a video from outside Epstein's jail cell as proof he actually killed himself.
          Bondi cited the existence of "tens of thousands" of videos that she said showed Epstein "with children or child porn" as the reason for no more public releases, despite multiple people who participated in the criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell saying they had not seen and did not know of a trove of recordings along the lines of what Bondi had referenced. 
          Indictments and detention memos also don't allege the existence of video recordings and neither Epstein nor Maxwell were charged with possession of child sex abuse material even though that would have been easier for prosecutors to prove than the sex trafficking counts they faced.

          After the July 7 memo, Trump had to deal with the fallout on Twitter from his conspiracy brained followers, who were calling for Bondi to be fired.
          Trump chose to stand with Bondi, saying "I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case is of interest to anybody," and urging his followers to just move on.

          On July 17, Trump asked for a release of grand jury testimony from the Epstein case but also said he would not recommend appointing a special prosecutor on the case.
          U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida on July 23 denied the administration's request to unseal records from the grand jury investigations in 2005 and 2007 finding that the request did not fall into any of the limited exceptions that may allow for the release of such material.
          Manhattan-based U.S. District Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer responded to the DOJ and asked them to flesh out the legal bases for the requests.
          On July 30, the DOJ responded saying unsealing the materials would be appropriate given the "abundant public interest" in the Epstein case and persistent scrutiny of how it was handled by federal law enforcement.

          On July 18, Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and its owners including Rupert Murdoch for $10 billion over the newspaper's report that his name was on a 2003 birthday greeting for Epstein, calling Trump's alleged birthday greeting "fake." 
          The day before, the WSJ reported on a letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people.
          The WSJ said the letter had typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker and that the the letter concluded "Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret," featuring the signature "Donald."
          A $10 billion award would far exceed the largest defamation judgments and settlements in recent history, including a $1.5 billion judgment against Alex Jones, and Fox News' settlement for $787.5 million with Dominion Voting.

          On July 23, the WSJ reported that Bondi told Trump in May that his name and "many other high-profile figures" appeared in Epstein investigative files.
          The White House sent mixed signals by initially saying the report was "fake news," but a White House official later told Reuters the administration was not denying that Trump's name appears in some files, noting that Trump was already included in the February documents for conservative influencers.
          The same day, U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg denied the DOJ's request for grand jury documents, saying that it did not fall into any of the exceptions to rules requiring grand jury material be kept secret.
          Also on the same day, the House Oversight Committee approved 8-2 a subpoena seeking all DOJ files on Epstein.

          On July 24 and 25, Deputy Attorney General and former personal lawyer to Trump, Todd Blanche met with Ghislaine Maxwell for interviews on more info about the Epstein case.
          The meeting was highly unusual, as senior officials typically do not personally conduct investigative interviews.
          When asked if he would consider a pardon for Maxwell, Trump said "It's something I haven't thought about."
          On August 22, the trascript from the Blanche-Maxwell interviews was released, where Maxwell said she was not aware of any "client list" belonging to the late financier and never saw President Donald Trump behave inappropriately.
          She also said she only ever worked with Bill Clinton on his philanthropic endeavors, and that he used Epstein's plane for a trip to Africa but that Clinton never visited Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

          On August 1, a week after the Blanche-Maxwell interviews, Maxwell was moved from a Florida prison to a lower-security facility in Texas to continue serving her 20-year sentence.
          Asked during a White House interview with Newsmax about the possibility of pardoning Maxwell, President Donald Trump said, "I'm allowed to do it, but nobody's asked me to do it."

          On August 11, Judge Engelmayer who reviewed the transcripts of the witness testimony heard by the grand jury and other evidence the panel saw, wrote that the government's assertion that the materials would reveal meaningful new information about Epstein's and Maxwell's crimes was "demonstrably false," and rejected having the trascript publicly released.
          "The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's," Engelmayer wrote.
          On August 20, Judge Berman rejected the DOJ bid to have grand jury documents unsealed, saying that the 70-odd pages of materials the grand jury saw paled in comparison to the 100,000 pages the government had but is not releasing.
          Berman also said the bid to persuade him to unseal the records was an apparent distraction from the DOJ's decision in July not to release its files.

          On September 26, U.S. Congressional Democrats released Epstein's daily schedules from 2014 to 2019, which showed Epstein had plans to meet with Elon Musk and Peter Thiel and conservative commentator Steve Bannon.
          The documents also showed Britain's Prince Andrew flew on Epstein's private jet in 2000.
          There were no accusations of any wrongdoing by Musk, Thiel, Bannon or Andrew in the documents and the daily calendars do not indicate whether Epstein's meetings with Musk, Thiel and Bannon in fact took place.

        <li><u>Obama Treason</u>
          On July 18, 2025, Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents and said the information she was releasing showed a "treasonous conspiracy" in 2016 by top Obama administration officials to undermine Trump and threatened to refer the officials to the DOJ.
          However, Gabbard conflated two separate U.S. intelligence findings in alleging that Obama had changed an assessment that Russia probably was not trying to influence the election through cyber means.
          One finding was that Russia was not trying to hack U.S. election infrastructure to change vote counts and the second was that Moscow probably was using cyber means to influence the U.S. political environment through information and propaganda operations, including by stealing and leaking data from Democratic Party servers.
          In January 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment ordered by Obama built on that second finding: that Putin authorized influence operations to sway the 2016 vote to Trump.
          On July 22, amid the Epstein fallout, Trump accused Obama of "treason" for leading an effort to falsely tie him to Russia and undermine his 2016 presidential campaign.
          Trump said, "It's time to start, after what they did to me, and whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people. Obama has been caught directly."
          Obama denounced Trump's claims, saying "these bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction."
          On July 2, CIA director Ratcliffe found flaws in the production of the January 2017 assessment but did not contest its conclusion and upheld "the quality and credibility" of a highly classified CIA report on which the assessment's authors relied.

          He also directed the IRS to go after any philanthropic groups funding political violence (the memo came just after Charlie Kirk and the Dallas ICE shootings).

            “If Antifa were really burning cities down nationwide for months, we’d have seen hundreds of prosecutions for terrorism. Instead, most 2020 riot cases were about property damage or curfew violations, and even Fox News covered most defendants as local offenders — not Antifa soldiers.”
            “If Antifa were as organized as people say, the FBI would’ve done mass arrests or RICO charges — but even under Trump, they didn’t. That’s a clue that it’s less of an organization and more of a loose label.”
            “If Antifa really were this huge national terror network, why didn’t Trump’s DOJ charge anyone under terrorism laws? You’d think Barr would’ve jumped on that.”
            “If Barr, Wray, and even Trump’s appointees were all deep state, then who isn’t deep state? How can you tell?”
            “How can Antifa be both this massive, centrally organized force and just a bunch of masked anarchists without hierarchy? Which is it?”
            “If cities were burned down by Antifa, why do insurance and police reports show most damage was caused by random looters or opportunists?”
          -->
          On September 22, Trump designated Antifa as a "domestic terrorist organization."
          During Trump's first term, he failed twice to designate antifa as a terrorist organization due to the US having no legal statute to designate domestic organizations as terrorist organizations.
          The DOJ said the designation would allow them to more closely track the finances and movements of U.S. citizens and to investigate any foreign ties of the loose network of groups and nonprofits the Trump says is antifa.
          Legal experts have said the domestic terrorism designation may be legally and constitutionally dubious, hard to execute and raise free-speech concerns, given that subscription to an ideology is not generally considered criminal under U.S. law.
          Antifa originated in the anti-fascist movements in Europe in the early 1900s and gained further popularity within the US after Trump's 2016 election.
          Antifa is short for "anti-fascist" and is not an organized political group in the traditional sense, being a decentralized movement without a clear structure, command hierarchy or leader.
          The movement operates as a loose collection of local groups that are independent of one another, but might share plans, tactics and resources either in person or through encrypted messaging apps.
          Antifa activists cluster into "affinity groups," informal units of three to eight people who trust and protect each other during protests.
          Antifa believe in "direct action," which can take the form of street protests or violent conduct such as burning police cars or shattering windows, and they also often wear black and cover their faces.
          Online activism includes tracking right-wing groups or doxxing those they view to be right-wing extremists.
          The most notorious episode involving Antifa occurred in Portland in August 2020 when Michael Reinoehl, a self-identified antifa supporter, shot and killed Aaron Danielson, a member of the far-right group Patriot Prayer.
          Recently, a San Diego jury found two antifa members guilty of conspiracy to riot during street protests in 2021.

              Matt Taibbi and Michael Shellenberger testify with allegations that a CIA government-funded and directed academic cabal had mass-censored conservatives, taking instruction from the deep state and communicating it to the platforms.
              This included using AI and secret portals to censor "22 million tweets" while preventing the public from seeing "entire narratives" during the 2020 election and Covid-19 pandemic.
              It had even demanded Twitter censor "true stories of vaccine side effects."
              After those accused produced emails to the committee, the "22 million censored tweets" became 4,700 URLs that teams of mostly student researchers had flagged across all platforms, with companies ignoring 65% and primarily labeling the remaining 35%.
              Federal agencies were not sending content through for suppression.
              The "true stories of vaccine side effects" claim also came from Taibbi cutting an email in half and misrepresenting a bullet in a list of content categories the project was tracking; there had been no demands made.
              The committee went on for two more years interviewing dozens of big tech executives, which concluded companies maintained independence despite government outreach.

        <li><u>EPA Funding</u>
          In February 2025, Trump signed an EO to establish the "National Energy Dominance Council" upon which he assigned the DOJ to assist the EPA in rescinding $20 billion in grants awarded under Biden for climate and clean energy projects.
          In connection with this, Trump asked the head of the criminal division at the AG's office, Denise Cheung, to open a criminal grand-jury investigation for wire fraud and conspiracy into one of these contracts awarded under Biden.
          Cheung refused to open the investigation, citing lack of evidence, upon which she was ordered instead to pursue an asset seizure to prevent the recipient of the contract from getting funding.
          Cheung consulted with the FBI before deciding to recommend a "30-day administrative freeze on certain assets," which the Trump admin told her was no adequate and again demanded a full freeze and asked her to resign.
          On February 18, Cheung announced her resignation after 24 years with the DOJ.

          On March 18, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan issued a TRO on the EPA's termination of three environmental nonprofit groups' grant agreements (the ones Cheung was assigned to look into) and barring Citibank from dispersing grant funding held at the bank in their accounts. 
          Chutkan said that the EPA had asserted substantial fraud, waste, and abuse with the contracts but only provided vague assertions to back up that claim. 
          The grants were terminated as part of Zeldin's campaign to claw back money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, aimed at curbing pollution.
          The three groups are Climate United, Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities.

          On September 2, U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 to overturn Chutkan's ruling, allowing Trump to move forward with terminating more than $16 billion in grants awarded to the non-profits.
          In their ruling, the court said Judge Chutkan lacked jurisdiction to hear the case brought by five of eight of the non-profits

          On August 18, the USDA said it would no longer support solar and wind projects on productive farmland.
          The USDA has provided over $2 billion for renewable energy projects, like solar and wind, through its Rural Energy for America Program and has also supported clean energy projects for rural electric cooperatives.
          About 424,000 acres of rural land were affected by wind turbines and solar farms in 2020, less than 0.05% of the nearly 900 million acres used for farmland, with most of that land staying in agricultural production after the development of the solar or wind projects, according to a 2024 USDA study.
          Biden supported solar and wind projects in rural areas and on farms as part of its effort to cut climate-harming emissions and make clean energy more affordable.

        <li><u>Endagerment Finding</u>
          In the landmark 2007 Supreme Court decision Massachusetts v. EPA, the court ruled that the EPA has the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and required the agency to make a scientific finding on whether those emissions endanger public health.
          Following the decision, in 2009, Obama's EPA issued a finding that emissions from new motor vehicles contribute to pollution and endanger public health and welfare.
          On July 29, 2025, EPA head Lee Zeldin said they were repealing the endangerment finding, setting up for an end to current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from vehicle tailpipes, power plants, smokestacks and other sources, and hamper future U.S. efforts to combat global warming.
          Zeldin said the 2024 Supreme Court Chevron case meant that the EPA didn't have the ability to regulate greenhouse gases anymore.

          Trump began a campaign to wipe out the Biden-era offshore wind industry in the US, citing inefficient technology that harms whales and birds.
          However, there was an unattented consequence to the shipbuilding industry, which Trump is an advocate for, with impacts including more than $679 million worth of canceled Department of Transportation financing for ports to support offshore wind, including a $426.7 million contract for California and a $34 million grant for Massachusetts that was expected to generate $75 million in tax revenue over 20 years and create 800 jobs.
          Orders for new offshore wind service vessels - designed to carry workers and huge turbines offshore or to lay undersea cable - have also disappeared.
          Other impacts include Maersk cancelling a $475 million contract for a New York wind project, 
          Offshore wind sector has cumulatively attracted $5.1 billion in port investments and $1.8 billion in vessel orders.

          On April 18, US District Judge Julia Kobick in Boston issued a preliminary injunction, that ordered Trump to allow six trans plaintiffs to obtain passports consistent with their gender identities. 
          Kobick declined to make the injunction nationwide.
          Kobick said Trump's policy of refusing to issue passports to transgender and nonbinary Americans that reflect their gender identities is likely unconstitutional.

          On May 21, 2025, a lone gunman opened fire with a handgun outside of a Jewish museum in Chicago as people were leaving an event for young professionals and diplomats hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.
          In the shooting, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, both Israeli Embassy staffers and a young couple about to become engaged to be married, were killed. 
          The gunman was Elias Rodriguez, who was charged with two counts of first degree murder for the killings.
          Surveillance video showed Rodriguez firing several times at Lischinsky and Milgrim, then leaning over them to fire several more rounds after they fell to the ground and after Milgrim tried to crawl away and sat up, then he paused to reload and resumed firing.
          Rodriguez told police on the scene, "I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza" and chanted "Free Palestine" after he was taken into custody.
          Rodriguez also posted a manifesto on social media the day before the shooting, titled "Escalate For Gaza, Bring The War Home," it condemned Israel's killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians since the October 2023 Hamas attacks, and discussed the morality of "armed" action.
          Rodriguez was once involved with the far-left Party for Socialism and Liberation that ended in 2017, the PSL said they had nothing to do with the attack and do not support it.
          Rodriguez was also identified in a 2018 local news report as a member of the Chicago branch of a national group called ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), which has organized demonstrations in solidarity with Palestinians.
          Trump and Netanyahu both condemned the shooting as antisemetic.

        <li><u>Minnesota lawmakers killed</u>
          On June 14, 2025, Minnesota Police and the FBI issued a manhunt after a man posing as a police officer killed former Minnesota State House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, before fleeing on foot after getting in a fire-fight with law enforcement.
          The suspect was identified as Vance Luther Boelter, who also seriously wounded Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman and his wife after shooting them multiple times before going to the Hortman's. 
          Police found Boether's abandoned vehicle, disguised as a police SUV, where they found a "manifesto" and a target list of about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states. 
          The list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats including Walz, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, Senator Tina Smith and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.
          In response to the events, the organizing No Kings Coalition canceled all protests in Minnesota (shooting was on same day as Trump birthday parade), citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect's at-large status.
          "Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!" Trump said in response to the killings.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/minnesota-state-lawmakers-shot-search-underway-suspect-local-media-reports-say-2025-06-14/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On June 16, police finally found and arrested Boelter.
          According to social media postings, Boelter had links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa.
          Boelter was charged on state charges with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder.
          In speaking to the New York Times, Boelter was deeply conservative Christian, saying "Because I love my neighbors prior to June 14th I conducted a 2 year long undercover investigation."
          Boelter had also written to himself, "Doing what most people know needs to be done ... but are not willing to do it themselves."
          In 1985, Boelter went from being a baseball loving teenager in college to becoming a deeply religious "hypnotic zombie."
          Boelter later graduated from unaccredited Christ for the Nations in 1990 and returned to Minnesota to start a ministry, then returned to St. Cloud State University, earning a degree in international relations in 1996.
          Over the years Boelter took on many jobs, moving his wife and five kids from state to state along with him.
          In 2021, Mr. Boelter and his wife founded a venture called Red Lion Group, which focused on business and Christian-outreach opportunities in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
          In a 2023 sermon he gave in the Congo, he said "they don't know abortion is wrong in many churches."
          In the late summer of 2023, Mr. Boelter began collecting bodies for one funeral home in the Twin Cities area, and then a second — "to pay the bills."
          In February 2025, Boelter abruptly quit his job delivering bodies and returned to the Congo.
          According to Boelter's best friend, in the months before the murders, he developed a strong distrust of government, especially Democrats, believing that the criminal prosecutions of Trump were politically motivated, and that a victory by Kamala Harris would lead to civil war. 
          He also began following the Infowars website and watching Alex Jones.
          Boelter then planned for weeks, compiling a list of targets, before executing the attacks on June 14.
          In a rambling, largely incoherent letter Mr. Boelter wrote to the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, shortly before his arrest, he claimed the shootings were part of a dark political conspiracy involving Minnesota's governor and the state's senate seats.
          "No one was aware of what I was investigating, not my wife, family, friends or co-workers," he told The Times. 
          "That is why many are having a very tough time understanding what is going on."

          Later on June 16, Boelter appeared in court where it was revealed he visited 4 other legislators homes on the night of the killings.
          The affidavit said Boelter planned the attack for some time with his notebook containing the names and, in some cases, home addresses for more than 45 elected officials, "mostly or all Democrats."

          On June 17, Trump said he would not call Minnesota Governor Waltz about the shooting.
          Trump said "I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling him. Why would I call him?"
          and "The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?"
          Trump also repeated false statements that originated from Benny Johnson, DC_Draino and Mike Cernovich that Boelter was close to Mike Walz due to Waltz reappointing Boelter in 2019 to a state board focused on Minnesota's workforce.
          Walz said the governor's office appoints thousands of people of all political affiliations to legislature-created unpaid, external boards and commissions.
          Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, who served from 2011 to 2019, appointed Boelter as a "private sector representative" on the Governor's Workforce Development Board.
          On Dec. 9, 2019, Walz reappointed Boelter to serve on the group as a "business member." The board — which has about 60 members, 41 of whom are appointed by the governor — analyzes and recommends to the governor and state Legislature workforce policies related to things such as talent development or addressing barriers to employment — to help Minnesota maintain a globally competitive labor force, according to its website.
          Boelter's most recent term on the board expired Jan. 2, 2023.
          However, this didn't stop twitter conservatives from running with the theory that Walz personnaly ordered the assassinations due to Hortman and Hoffman "both recently voted against their party, with Hortman supporting repeal of free healthcare for illegals and Hoffman joining Republicans in the Senate to pass it."
          Hortman was the only Democrat who voted with Republicans to pass the budget bill that would remove adult immigrants in the U.S. illegally from the state's MinnesotaCare health program but Hoffman voted against the bill that would end such coverage.

        <li><u>Manhattan NFL Shooting</u>
          On July 28, 2025, Shane Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental illness struggles, killed four people in a shooting rampage at a Midtown Manhattan office building.
          Tamura used an M4 Carbine semi-automatic rifle during the shooting before taking his own life.
          Tamura was carrying a note, blaming the NFL for his degenerative brain disease (CTE).
          Tamura was never an NFL player, but online records show he played in high school.
          Tamura appeared to have driven to New York City from Las Vegas over three days and to have acted alone, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
          The NFL has its headquarters in the skyscraper, but Tamura apparently entered the wrong elevator bank and ended up in the offices of Rudin Management, a real estate company, where he shot employees.
          Among those killed was a Blackstone senior executive Wesley LePatner (Blackstone's headquarters is in the same tower) and NYPD officer, Didarul Islam, 36, who came from Bangladesh and had been on the force three years.

        <li><u>Minneapolis Catholic School Shooting</u>
          On August 27, 2025, a shooting occurred at the Annunciation Church, which is also home to an elementary school with students from preschool through eighth grade.
          The assailant was armed with three guns (rifle, shotgun and pistol, all legally and recently purchased) and fired through stained-glass windows into the Catholic church where parish school students were attending Mass, killing two children (aged 8 and 10) and wounding 17 other people.
          The shooting took place on the first week back to school during an all-school Mass held annually on the first Wednesday of the academic year.
          FBI Director Kash Patel said they were investigating the attack as an "act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics."
          The lone suspect was identified as Robin Westman, 23, who "took his own life" at the rear of the church following the attack.
          A 2017 yearbook from the school showed that Westman, who went by the first name Robert at the time, had been a student there.
          In an online video posted on YouTube by Westman, she showed the text of a suicide note expressing feeling depressed and wanting to carry out a mass shooting, having names of previous school shooters scrawled on a rifle magazine, along with erratic and wide-ranging political grievances, and also a belief that death was near because of a vaping habit.
          Westman's writings included anti-Catholic prejudice and a call for the killing of U.S. President Donald Trump
          DHS Secretary Kristie Noem said the suspect was "claiming to be transgender," and court records showed Westman's name was changed from Robert in 2020 because Westman identified as female. 
          Trump ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff nationwide as a sign of mourning.

          Following the shooting, conservatives online were quick to blame the attack on Westman's "transgender identity" and called for trans people to be barred from owning guns.
          The online rhetoric echoed similar claims made by Donald Trump Jr. following the 2023 Nashville private school shooting where the shooter was identified as transgender and conservatives began <a href="https://archive.ph/pnSqs" target="_blank">saying</a> "the modern trans movement is radicalizing activists into terrorists."
          By March 2023, there had been four shootings involving trans/nonbinary shooters including: one in November 2020 at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs; a 2019 shooting at a Denver-area school by two shooters, one of them a trans man; a 2018 shooting at a Maryland warehouse; and the Nashville school shooting.
          Using the Gun Violence Archive (mass shooting meaning at least four gun injuries), there have been more than 4,400 mass shootings between 2013-2023, with the number of trans shooters being less than 10, translating to 0.11% of the total shootings.
          Further, in a U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) report with data from 2016 to 2020 that examined 173 attacks in the U.S. "that resulted in harm to three or more individuals in public locations," found that of the 173 attacks, three of the attackers were trans, five were female, and the rest were male.
          As of August 2025, 1.0% of those aged 13 and older in the US (2.8 million people) <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Pop-Update-Aug-2025.pdf" target="_blank">identify</a> as transgender.

          On September 10, 2025, conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 31, was <a href="https://x.com/stillgray/status/1965854630623195444" target="_blank">shot</a> and killed while hosting a debate event at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah.
          Kirk was an Illinois native who founded the conservative student group Turning Point USA when he was 18 and went on to become a rising star in the Republican Party under Trump, drawing 500,000 monthly podcast listeners and amassing 5.3 million X followers.
          Turning Point USA is an organization dedicated to advancing conservative causes on college campuses and was instrumental in driving youth support for Trump in the 2024 election.
          The Utah governor described Kirk's death as a "political assassination," despite there being no suspect or motive yet determined.
          After the shooting Trump posted on Truth, "He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us."
          Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff in Kirk's honor and said he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
          JD Vance canceled his trip to New York to commemorate the 9/11 attacks, and instead traveled to Utah to see Kirk's family and to fly them and Kirk's casket home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two.
          Kirk left behind two young children and his wife.
          Seconds before he was shot Kirk was being questioned by an audience member about gun violence, "Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America in the last 10 years?"
          He responded, "Counting or not counting gang violence?" moments before being shot.
          Awareness of Kirk's shooting spread faster than past news events because observers filmed videos from multiple angles and posted them on video-based platforms.

          Kirk's rhetoric, which often involved anti-LGBTQ and anti-immigrant comments, engendered strong feelings.
          Moments before he was killed Charlie was taking a question about transgender people and mass shootings.
          "Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?" the event attendee asked.
          "Too many," Kirk replied.
          In debates across the country, on college campuses, podcasts and on X, Kirk seemed to relish confrontation, casting himself as a champion of free speech and the open exchange of ideas.
          He occasionally struck conciliatory notes, telling Tucker Carlson in a July interview: "How do we actually de-radicalize the country in the next couple of years? That's my obsession."
          The day pop star Taylor Swift announced her engagement to NFL player Travis Kelce, Kirk <a href="https://x.com/mmfa/status/1960416119782518874" target="_blank">told</a> her, "you're not in charge," urging her to "reject feminism" and "submit to your husband."
          Kirk dismissed affirmative action and diversity, equity and inclusion programs and people he perceived as having benefited from them.
          "MLK was awful," Kirk <a href="https://archive.ph/FP0MD" target="_blank">said</a>. 
          "He's not a good person. He said one good thing he actually didn't believe ... I have a very, very radical view on this, but I can defend it, and I've thought about it," Kirk said at America Fest. 
          "We made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s." 
          Kirk argues that the Civil Rights Act, ushered in a "permanent DEI-type bureaucracy."
          On a July 2023 episode of his show, he said TV personality Joy Reid, former First Lady Michelle Obama, the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson did not have the intelligence to achieve what they did without affirmative action. 
          "You had to go steal a white person's slot to be taken somewhat seriously," he <a href="https://x.com/alluring_nyc/status/1965931096539017536" target="_blank">said</a>.
          Kirk also opposed transgender rights and his organization sponsored rallies against transgender medical care.
          In April 2024, he <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-we-need-have-nuremberg-style-trial-every-gender-affirming-clinic-doctor" target="_blank">likened</a> doctors who perform gender-affirming care to Nazis committing atrocities.
          "One issue I think that is so against our senses, so against the natural law and dare I say a throbbing middle finger to God, is the transgender thing happening in America right now," he <a href="https://x.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1701335984309223455" target="_blank">said</a> during a speech posted in 2023 by Right Wing Watch.
          In the same speech, he cited a Bible verse saying that a woman who puts on men's clothes or a man who puts on a woman's garment is an "abomination."
          During his show in April 2022, he <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/3986864/embed/embed" target="_blank">argued</a> that gay couples "are not happy just having marriage. Instead, they now want to corrupt your children."
          After January 6, 2021, when many Republicans thought Trump's political career was over, Kirk <a href="https://x.com/girlsreallyrule/status/1348603383968649216" target="_blank">embraced</a> the Stop the Steal movement claiming the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats.

          At the same time of the Kirk assassination, there was also a mass shooting at Evergreen High School near Denver.
          The county was the same one as the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that killed 14 people.
          The shooter, student Desmond Holly, died of self-inflicted wounds after wounding two others.
          Holly was a 16-year-old boy who had been radicalized by an unspecified "extremist network" and used a revolver in the shooting.
          Holly was later found to have been active on an online forum where users watch videos of killings and violence (Watch People Die), mixed in with content on white supremacism and antisemitism.
          Holly's TikTok accounts also contained white supremacist symbols.
          A few days before the shooting, Holly posted a TikTok video posing in a similar way to how a recent December 2024 Wisconsin shooter posed before killing two people, including a photo of the Wisconsin shooter in a post in which Holly wore black T-shirt with “WRATH” written on the front.

          The day of the shooting, the House observed a "moment of prayer for Charlie Kirk and his family" at the request of Speaker Mike Johnson. 
          A subsequent request for a "moment of prayer out loud" elicited vocal objections and chaos on the House floor. 
          Footage shows members standing silently for about 30 seconds. 
          Johnson then bangs his gavel and Rep. Lauren Boebert says that "silent prayers get silent results" before requesting that someone lead a spoken prayer as well. 
          An audible "no" can be heard in response, among other protests. 
          Shouting continues for about a minute, requiring Johnson to bang his gavel and state, "the House will be in order" several times. 
          Many posts claiming that Democrats had opposed a moment of prayer for Kirk shared clips that omitted Johnson's initial request and the ensuing silence.

          His death left many conservatives seething and blaming liberals for the assault, while Democrats largely kept to a more reserved tone, decrying political violence generally and again calling for stronger gun laws.
          White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said "All of us must now dedicate ourselves to defeating the evil that stole Charlie from this world."
          MAGA loyalist Laura Loomer called for "cracking down on the Left with the full force of the government. Every single Left wing group that funds violent protests needs to be shut down and prosecuted. No mercy."
          Elon Musk was even more blunt, saying "The Left is the party of murder."
          Trump - who routinely refers to his political rivals as "radical left lunatics" who he warns represent an existential threat to America - called the shooting an outgrowth of overheated rhetoric saying, "Violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree - day after day, year after year - in the most hateful and despicable way possible."
          However, Trump decided to fan the flames, going on to say "For years, those on the radical left have <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-fascist-jd-vance-b2614984.html" target="_blank">compared</a> wonderful Americans like Charlie to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-social-media-account-shares-and-deletes-video-referencing-a-unified-reich" target="_blank">Nazis</a> and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals ... This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now."
          The reaction from Democrats was more muted, with Obama saying, "We don't yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy."
          Democratic former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, who was critically wounded by a gunman in 2012, said, "Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence."
          Numerous other Democratic leaders urged for calm and condemned Kirk's murder. 
          "Political violence is NEVER acceptable," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. 
          Gavin Newsom called the attack on Kirk "disgusting, vile and reprehensible," and urged Americans to "reject political violence in EVERY form."
          One exception was Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who blamed Trump, saying, "It's gotta stop ... I think there are people who are fomenting it in this country. I think the president's rhetoric often foments it."
          The shooting came amid conservatives, including Trump, spotlighting the August 22 killing of a Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, claiming it was a product of liberal criminal-justice policies.
          Kirk said on Fox News the "narrative" advanced by liberals "in the past 10 years (is) that there is a relentless assault against Black people on behalf of white people."
          Kirk said that was not true. "White individuals are more likely to be attacked, especially per capita, by black individuals in this country."
          On social media, angry MAGA pointed to posts that appeared to celebrate Kirk's death as evidence of conservatives increasingly being targeted.
          Fueled by years of rhetoric, amplified by social media echo chambers, this anger reflected a broader narrative in which Trump's allies often portray themselves as besieged patriots facing a lawless and hostile opposition.
          Stewart Rhodes, the pardoned founder of the Oath Keepers militia who was sentenced to 18 years for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, urged Trump to declare martial law and mobilize veterans as militia leaders during an appearance on Alex Jones' show.
          Chaya Raichik, known for he Libs of TikTok account, posted screenshots of social media users who celebrated Kirk's death. 
          Ryan Nichols, a January 6 rioter pardoned by Trump, urged followers to identify and harass those individuals, saying "Tag them, their employers, and make it so uncomfortable for them to even leave their house ... This is the way!"

          By the end of the day of the shooting, authorities still had no suspect in custody, with the lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper's nest on campus, remaining "at large."
          State police issued a statement on the night of the shooting saying that two men had been detained and one was interrogated by law enforcement, but both were subsequently released.
          FBI director Kash Patel, in incompetent fashion, <a href="https://archive.ph/LWigN" target="_blank">tweeted</a> "The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody. Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah" before <a href="https://archive.ph/81l3v" target="_blank">tweeting</a> again hours later "The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.  Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency."
          On September 11, the FBI said the shooter jumped off the roof and fled into an adjoining neighborhood and that investigators found a "high-powered, bolt-action" rifle in a nearby wooded area.
          Later in the day, the FBI released photos and a video of a person of interest in the shooting and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest.
          Utah Governor Spencer Cox appealed to the public for help, saying "We cannot do our job without the public's help right now," and that investigators had received over 7,000 tips from the public and had conducted over 200 interviews.

          On September 12, Governor Spencer Cox said a young man, Tyler Robinson, 22, had been taken into custody, capping the 33-hour manhunt.
          A break in the case came when a relative and a family friend alerted the local sheriff's office that he had confessed to them.
          Robinson had confessed to a family friend - or "implied that he had committed" the murder to that friend - and that person in turn contacted the Washington County sheriff's office on September 11.
          Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College and was taken into custody at his parents' house, about 260 miles southwest of the crime scene.
          Robinson briefly attended Utah State University in Logan for one semester in fall 2021 before dropping out.
          A family member said Robinson had become more political recently and and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints.
          Robinson's father recognized him from images released by authorities and encouraged him to turn himself in. 
          He refused at first, but then changed his mind after Robinson's father reached out for help to a youth pastor, who helped Robinson turn himself in.
          Investigators spoke to Robinson's roommate, who showed them comments Robinson had made on Discord discussing retrieving a rifle from a drop point and then dropping it in a bush wrapped in a towel, matching the description of the gun recovered after the shooting in a wooded area near campus.
          Robinson seemingly had a bright future ahead of him, having scored in the top percentile on his college entrance exam and earned himself a four-year scholarship to Utah State University in Logan. 
          His proud mother posted a video on Facebook in which her first-born son, the oldest of three, read aloud the school's letter offering him the grant.
          He was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party and was listed as an "inactive" voter due to not participating in the 2024 election.
          Canaan Timothy, 21, said he was in the year below Robinson at high school and that he was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.
          "I knew him in passing. Just your average kid," said Timothy, "Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet."
          The Robinsons are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon church), but a neighbor described them as inactive members.
          Ammunition found at the scene had been inscribed with what appeared to be anti-fascist messages, including: "Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao" (anti-fascist Italian song); "If you read this, you are gay, LMAO"; and "Hey fascist, catch!" followed by an up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrow symbols (originally claimed to be "trans" arrows by Steven Crowder but later found to reference a sequence of controller moves that unleashes bombs in the popular video game Helldivers 2).
          The casing found at the shooting said "Notices bulges OwO what's this?" (furry gooner meme).
          On September 14, Cox said that Robinson was not cooberating with authorities but investigators have been interviewing his friends and family to determine a motive. 
          One person who is apparently talking to investigators is Robinson's roommate, who was also a romantic partner, Cox said, describing them as "a male transitioning to female," and that they had been "incredibly cooperative."
          On September 15, Kash Patel said Robinson's DNA had been found at the scene and they discovered a physical note that was destroyed that he had left saying he had the "opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk" and would do so.
          WaPo also reported Robinson had sent a Discord message shortly after the shooting saying "It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this."

          On September 12, in her first public comments since her spouse was slain, Erika Kirk vowed in a tearful but defiant video message that "the movement built by my husband will not die" but grow stronger.
          Speaking from the studio of his radio-podcast show, she urged young people to join Turning Point, exalting her husband as a fallen political hero who "now and for all eternity will stand at his savior's side wearing the glorious crown of a martyr."
          On September 18, Erika Kirk was named CEO of Turning Point USA.

          Following the shooting many conservatives online said politically motivated attacks were a left-wing phenomenon.
          However, according to a 2022 Maryland START study, of the 1563 individuals who committed violent or non-violent political attacks in the US from 1948-2018, 17.6% were Islamic, 23.4% were left-wing, and 59% were right-wing.
          They also found that for violent terrorists attacks, 55% were Islamic, 35% were right-wing, and 23% were left-wing.
          According to the ADL, in 2023, white supremacists were tied to the overwhelming majority (88%) of extremist-related murders.
          The two deadliest incidents in 2023 were extremist-related shooting sprees by white supremacists: the Allen, Texas, mall shooting in May, and the store shooting in Jacksonville, Florida, in August.

          <u>Industrial Cancellation Complex</u>
          In the days following the killing, many on the online left took to social media to criticise Kirk's legacy and even cheer on his death.
          This resulted in the U.S. military taking swift disciplinary action against U.S. troops over social media posts linked to Kirk, carrying out a "zero-tolerance" policy toward those it sees as cheering his death, with those being disciplined likely in the dozens according to officials.
          After years of complaints from the right about "cancel culture" from the left, some conservatives began seeking to upend the lives and careers of those who disparaged Kirk after his death. 
          This birthed a campaign by public officials and others on the right to begin calling for the firing or punishment of teachers, an Office Depot employee, government workers, a TV pundit.
          Trump's State Department in the minutes after Kirk's death warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination.
          Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn called on social media for the firings of an assistant dean at Middle Tennessee State University and professors at Austin Peay State University and Cumberland University.
          This resulted in all three losing their jobs for their comments, that included expressing pleasure for Kirk's death, with one saying Kirk "spoke his fate into existence."
          Some NFL teams chose on Sunday to hold a moment of silence for Kirk, with the teams that didn't participate being called out by the right.
          On September 17, ABC cancelled late-night host and frequent Trump critic Jimmy Kimmel's show after he suggested on his show "We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it."
          Kimmel's comments led to a response from FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who urged local broadcasters to stop airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on ABC and suggested the commission could open an investigation and that broadcasters could potentially be fined or lose their licenses if there was a pattern of distorted comment.
          The nation's largest local television station group, Nexstar Media and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns many of ABC's local TV affiliates, said they would stop airing the show following Kimmel's monologue. 
          Sinclair said Kimmel's show would be suspended until he apologizes to the Kirk family. 
          Nexstar and Sinclair both have merger deals pending before the FCC (Nexstar's $6.2 billion merger with Tegna).
          Trump celebrated the suspension of the Jimmy Kimmel Show and said TV broadcasters should lose their licenses over negative coverage of his administration, saying "They're getting a license, I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr."
          However, on September 22, six days after his suspension, Disney said that the Kimmel show would be returning the next day.
          The U-turn came after several prominent conservatives, including U.S. Senator Ted Cruz joined Democrats in criticizing the head of the FCC for threatening retaliation against ABC and a mounting campaign against Disney of consumers cancelling Disney+.
          However, both Nextstar and Sinclair later said they would still boycott his show.
          Trump responded on Truth Social that he "can't believe" ABC gave Kimmel back his show, and hinted at further action against the network.
          On September 26, both Nextstar and Sinclair both reversed their decision and said they would air the Kimmel show again.
          November 19: Reuters review finds that the Kirk cancellation campaign led to over 600 total firings, and that the campaign had the backing of Republican government officials, including public backings from Trump and Vance.
          In 2020, 22 academics were fired following comments about George Floyd and BLM and in 2024, 160 people were fired for pro-Palestine comments.
          Reuters found 15 people were punished for allegedly invoking "karma" or "divine justice," and 9 others for variations on "Good riddance."
          More than 350 education workers were fired, suspended or investigated in the days following the assassination, including 50 academics and senior university administrators, three high school principals, two cheerleading coaches and a theology instructor.
          Many educators did celebrate Kirk's death, including a Virginia teacher who wrote, "I hope he suffered through all of it," and a Texas middle school intern who said the shooting "made me giggle."
          Two top cancellers were Libs of TikTok and Scott Presler, who advocated for firings and doxxings on Twitter.
          Two notable firings was an Office Depot employee fired for refusing to print a poster memorializing Kirk and a Starbucks barista who wrote an anti-Kirk message on a cup of mint tea.  
          Another notable one was Clemson climate scientist Joshua Bregy, who shared a post saying "No one should be gunned down - not a school child, not an influencer, not a politician - no one. But am I going to allow people to make a martyr out of a flawed human being whose rhetoric caused notable damage? Not a chance."
          Clemson initially defended Bregy and "free speech," until Trump reposted a call to "Defund Clemson" upon which we was fired

          On September 16, Robinson made his first court appearance via video link from the county jail, where prosecutors vowed to seek the death penalty and <a href="https://atty.utahcounty.gov/cms/uploads/TJR_Information_49872215e3.pdf" target="_blank">revealed</a> new details of their case, including text messages in which he was alleged to have privately confessed to the fatal shooting and said "I had enough of his hatred."
          The death penalty in Utah requires 12 out of 12 jurors to agree to it in the penalty phase of a trial inorder for it to be imposed.
          Robinson was charged with seven criminal counts including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice for disposing of evidence and witness tampering for asking his roommate to delete incriminating texts.
          The prosecutor said Robinson was charged with aggravated murder because he put others at great risk of death, targeted Kirk for his political expression and knew children would witness the homicide.
          Robinson was ordered to remain held without bond in the Washington County Jail.
          Prosecutors said shortly after the shooting Robinson sent a text message telling his roommate and romantic partner to "drop what you're doing, look under my keyboard," where they found a physical note from Robinson that read: "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it."
          The roommate then asked Robinson in a text reply, "you weren't the one who did it right????" Robinson responded: "I am, I'm sorry."
          Then the roommate asked why he had shot Kirk, Robinson wrote back: "I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out." 
          He also asserted he had planned the attack for more than a week.
          Police had also executed a search warrant on Robinson's residence, where they discovered a shell casing with etchings like the etchings found on the shells in the abandoned rifle.

          The memorial featured speeches from other White House officials and had the feel of a religious revival mixed with a "Make America Great Again" rally, especially from Trump's speech, which included attacking Biden and reviving claims the 2020 election was stolen.
          Kirk's wife, Erika, delivered an emotional tribute to her late husband, looking up at the heavens and mouthing, "I love you," before speaking about his devotion to Christianity, his family and his activism. 
          "I want all of you to know, while Charlie died far too early, he was also ready to die," she said. "He left this world without regrets. He did 100% of what he could every day."
          She also offered forgiveness to the 22-year-old man who has been charged with Kirk's murder, citing the Bible's account that Jesus Christ urged his followers to forgive his tormentors while on the cross.
          "My husband Charlie wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life," she said, before adding tearfully, as the crowd applauded solemnly.
          This was in sharp contrast to Trump, who said of Kirk, "He did not hate his opponents ... That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents."

        <li><u>Pennsylvania Police Ambush</u>
          On September 17, five police officers were shot, three of them fatally, in Pennsylvania while attempting to serve an arrest warrant.
          The suspect, Matthew Ruth, 24, had opened fire on the officers with his AR-15 rifle and was himself killed in the ensuing gunfight.
          Ruth's warrant was for suspicion of stalking, prowling and trespassing.

        <li><u>Texas ICE Shootings</u>
          On September 24, 2025, there was a shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas, Texas.
          The shooter used a sniper from a nearby building and shot three ICE detainees, killing two, before killing himself.
          DHS said the suspect fired "indiscriminately" at the ICE facility, including at a van in the building's secured entryway where the victims were shot.
          The FBI later said they found bullets at the scene that read "ANTI-ICE"
          Trump was quick to accuse "Radical Left Democrats" of stoking anti-ICE violence by "constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to Nazis."
          Noem later confirmed the suspected shooter was identified as Joshua Jahn
          Investigators later found a note left by Jahn that he acted alone (not part of a "leftist network"), and intended to kill and "terrorize" ICE agents, whose work he viewed as "human trafficking." 
          The FBI also said Jahn used ICE-tracking apps and downloaded a list of local DHS facilities in preparation for the attack, as well as researching the shooting of Charlie Kirk only a few weeks earlier.
          Other Texas ICE shootings include a police officer was shot in July at an ICE detention center in Prairieland, and a Michigan man was shot dead by agents after opening fire on a U.S. Border Patrol station in McAllen in July.

        <li><u>Canada</u>
          On June 27, 2025, Trump abruptly cut off trade talks with Canada, saying that Canada's newly enacted digital services tax on U.S. technology firms was "a direct and blatant attack on our country."

          October 24: Trump again cuts off trade talks with Canada over an anti-tariff advertisement issued by Ontario's provincial government, that featured Ronald Reagan out of context saying tariffs cause trade wars and economic disaster.
          Ontario Premier Doug Ford said he ordered the ads to keep running during the weekend's baseball World Series games between the Toronto Blue Jays and Los Angeles Dodgers to reach a bigger U.S. audience but would halt the ads on Monday after speaking with PM Carney.
          White House adviser Kevin Hassett said Trump was frustrated with Canada and trade talks have not been going well, with the ad likely being a pre-text to cut off talks again.
          The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation said the ad used "selective audio and video."
          The ad's voiceover consists of Reagan criticizing tariffs saying they cause job losses and trade wars, by using five complete sentences from a 1987 five-minute weekly address, spliced together out of sequence.
          The ad didn't mention that Reagan was using the address to explain that tariffs imposed on Japan by his administration should be seen as a sadly unavoidable exception to his basic belief in free trade as the key to prosperity, due to Japan's unfair trade practices at the time.
          However, Reagan today would likely be against Trump's broad tariff regime to bring US manufacturing back.

          On May 12, 2025, the US and China agreed to a temporary truce in their tariff trade war, after days of talks mediated in Switzerland.
          The deal leaves US tariffs on China at 30% and China tariffs on the US at 10% from May 14 to August 12.

          China's exports to the U.S. fell an annual 21.7% in July, while shipments to Southeast Asia rose 16.6% over the same period as manufacturers sought to pivot to new markets.

          The framework agreements maintain 10% tariffs on most goods from El Salvador, Guatemala and Argentina, where the U.S. had modest trade surpluses, and 15% for imports from Ecuador, where the U.S. had a trade deficit.
          The deals included commitments to refrain from digital services taxes on U.S. companies, along with the removal of tariffs on U.S. agricultural and industrial goods.

        <li><u>Copper</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump announced 50% tariffs on copper piping, dragging down U.S. copper prices more than 17%.
          The move aids manufacturers, but does little to boost the constrained U.S. copper mining industry, which for years has asked Washington for permitting reform or other steps that could fuel growth.
          The move is essentially a boost for Chile and Peru, two of the world's largest copper miners and major suppliers to the United States.

          In Trump's proclamation, he laid out his argument that timber, lumber and furniture imports are eroding U.S. national security to justify the new duties under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1974.
          Trump said they would start on October 14 and that tariffs would increase on January 1 to 30% for upholstered wooden products and 50% for kitchen cabinets if no deals were reached.
          In April, after the Commerce Department opened the national security probe into U.S. lumber imports and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced its opposition to any restrictions on imports of timber, lumber and their derivative products, saying there was no national security risk.

          October 17, 2025: Trump imposes 25% tariffs on all medium, heavy duty trucks, parts; 10% tariffs on imported buses, citing national security.
          U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier urged Trump not to impose new truck tariffs, noting the top five import sources are Mexico, Canada, Japan, Germany, and Finland "all of which are allies or close partners of the United States posing no threat to U.S. national security."
          At the same time, he provided GM, Ford, Toyota Motor, Stellantis, Honda, and Tesla with tariff relief on imported auto parts that were previously imposed.

        <li><u>De minimis exemption</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump fully suspended the de minimis exception for all US good imports.
          In Trump's Big Beautiful Bill he repealed the legal basis for the de minimis exemption worldwide starting on July 1, 2027.
          Goods shipped through the postal system will face one of two tariffs: either an "ad valorem duty" equal to the effective tariff rate of the package's country of origin or, for six months, a specific tariff of $80 to $200 depending on the country of origin's tariff rate.
          Between 2015 and 2024, the annual volume of de minimis shipments entering the U.S. increased from 134 million shipments to over 1.36 billion shipments. U.S. Customs processes over 4 million daily de minimis shipments.

        <li><u>"Liberation Day"</u>
          On April 2, 2025, Trump imposes "reciprocal" tariffs at a base rate of 10% on 50+ countries and with larger tariffs on many of the countries. 
          In response to the tariffs, automaker Stellantis said it would temporarily lay off U.S. workers and close plants in Canada and Mexico, while General Motors said it would increase U.S. production.
          Howard Lutnick and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro both Trump would not back off, and that the tariff increases were not a negotiation.
          However, Trump later said, "The tariffs give us great power to negotiate."
          The Dow dropped 4% (worst since June 2020), the S&P500 dropped 5%, and the Nasdaq fell 6% (worst since March 2020) due to resurging inflation and recession worries.
          For the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.08%, the Nasdaq declined 10.02%, and the Dow fell 7.86%. The Russell 2000 Small Cap Index dropped 9.70%, confirming a bear market.
          Imports to the United States now face an average duty of 22.5%, up from 2.5% in 2024.
          The tariffs also alienated allies in Asia and undercut US strategic efforts to contain China.

          Tariff "calculation": 
          Trump's formula for calculating the tariffs was to take the U.S. goods trade deficit with a country, divide it by that country's exports to the U.S. and turn it into a percentage figure; then cut that figure in half to produce the U.S. "reciprocal" tariff, with a floor of 10%.
          This ended up making the uninhabited volcanic Australian territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic, largely inhabited by penguins, have a 10% tariff.
          This also disproportionately hurt the poorest countries in the world such as Madagascar (47% reciprocal tariff, $500 GDP per capita, $733 million of US exports), Lesotho (50% reciprocal tariff), Cambodia (49% reciprocal tariff).
          These countries are so poor they cannot import any US goods due to them being so expensive (they aren't buying Teslas), so they got punished with the sharpest tariff rates as a result.

        <li><u>The Problem with Tariffs</u>
            <u>Tariffs during Trump's first term</u> created several thousand jobs in the steel and washing machine industries but these gains were more than offset by losses in manufacturing, where higher import costs led to a decline in employment.

            <u>Retaliation</u>: the tariffs cause other countries to retaliate, not buy from the US anymore, dump their US bonds to raise rate on US debt (China has $769 bln and Japan has $1.01 tln)
            <u>Supply chains</u>: products today take a lot of parts, these parts come from all over the world meaning tariffs will drive up the price of manufacuring massively and cause stagflation.
            <u>Reduced military spending</u>: if the tariffs cause a recession that will decrease tax revenue, which will decrease defense spending, which will be worse for manufacturing, which is what the tariffs were meant to be for.
            <u>Recession from uncertainty</u>: uncertainty means no investments, which means no sales and no economic growth, with means recession.
            <u>Recession from lower consumer activity</u>: if consumers think the tariffs with go away in 2029 with a new administration they will wait to spend money, which will cause a recession.
            <u>Lower trade deficits</u>: if the US is not importing as much then other countries will have less US dollars, which means they will buy less treasury bonds, which means the US debt rate will increase (1% increase in intrest rates means +80B in annual US debt payments).
            <u>Mistrust of the US</u>: the tariffs included Taiwan and the EU, which are not countries and shows the lack of a plan of caring that went into crafting tariff policy, if people stop trusting the US then the reserve currency status of the US is at stake.
            <u>Bad Tax</u>: tariffs are regressive taxes that also stifle innovation and efficiency by distorting the market.

            This was further hurt when Argentinan President Javier Milei briefly suspended export taxes on soybeans in September, luring Chinese buyers who swiftly booked cargoes, which infuriated U.S. farmers due to the recent US provided $20 billion swap line for Argentina.
            U.S. soybean exports to China dropped 39% by volume to 5.9 million metric tons from January to July (drop of 51% to $2.5 billion by value).
            USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins previously said that Taiwan committed to $10 billion in U.S. agriculture purchases over the next four years, including soybeans, calling it a "game-changer," but it was misleading: since the already U.S. exported $3.8 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products to Taiwan in 2024 (would total $15 billion over 4 years).

          On July 31, Medvedev waded in again saying Trump's "nervous reaction" showed Russia was on the right course and referring again to Moscow's nuclear capabilities.
          This prompted Trump to deliver a statement the following day on posting U.S. nuclear submarines in "the appropriate regions."

          Witkoff, who was also at the meeting, said Russia is open to the idea of US security guarantees for Ukraine similar to NATO's Article 5 and that Russia had also agreed to passing a law against taking any more of Ukraine by force.
          Sources also said Trump and Putin discussed proposals for Russia to relinquish tiny pockets of occupied Ukraine in exchange for Ukraine ceding a swathe of fortified land in the east and freezing the front lines elsewhere.

          On August 18, Trump met with Zelensky and seven European leaders in Washington for ceasefire talks.
          Zelensky wore more formal clothing and repeatedly expressed his gratitude to Trump, trying to avoid a repeat of their February meeting.
          The meeting ended with little substance and progress, with Trump vowing to set up a meeting between Zelensky and Putin.
          However, there was one change from Trump after his meeting with Putin: he wanted to go straight to a peace deal without a ceasefire first, widely seen as a diplomatic defeat for Ukraine.

        <li><u>Russia-NATO Incursions</u>
          On September 10, 2025, Poland shot down suspected Russian drones in its airspace with the backing of NATO aircraft, the first time a NATO member hadfired shots during Russia's war in Ukraine.
          Polish F-16 fighter jets, Dutch F-35s, Italian AWACS surveillance planes, and NATO mid-air refuelling aircraft scrambled in an operation.
          Moscow denied responsibility for the incident, with a senior diplomat in Poland saying the drones had come from the direction of Ukraine.
          Trump, before meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki, a conservative nationalist, said "What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!"
          Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called the incident a "large-scale provocation" and said he had activated Article 4 of NATO's treaty, under which alliance members can demand consultations with their allies.
          Analysts and Western officials said Russia was testing the alliance's readiness and resolve.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/poland-downs-drones-its-airspace-becoming-first-nato-member-fire-during-war-2025-09-10/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On September 20, three Russian military jets violated NATO member Estonia's airspace for 12 minutes in another incursion, before Italian F-35s, currently stationed at a base in Estonia, pushed them out.
          Russia denied its jets violated Estonian airspace, saying they flew over neutral waters of the Baltic Sea.
          While incursions over the Vaindloo Island by Russian aircraft are fairly common, they do not usually last as long as this incident.
          Separately, Poland said two Russian fighter jets violated the safety zone of the Petrobaltic drilling platform in the Baltic Sea.
          When asked about the incident Trump said, "I don't love it. I don't like when that happens ... Could be big trouble. I'll let you know later."
          Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said his country had decided to ask NATO to open consultations under Article 4.
          In late August, the U.S. had said they planned to cut off some security assistance to Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.

          Trump had a muted reaction to the string of incidents, having largely withdrawn from diplomacy following his initial push for ceasefires in Ukraine and Gaza.
          After the Putin Alaska meeting, Trump told EU officials they should hit China and India with 100% tariffs to punish them for their purchases of Russian oil, portraying such a move as a precondition for U.S. action.

          Trump also backpedals on plans set out the week prior to have a Trump-Putin summit in Budapest, following an October 20 phone call he had with Putin where Putin reiterated his demand that Ukraine cede the entire Donbas.
          The demand flew in the face of Trump's calls for an immediate ceasefire at the current battle lines, something Kyiv agreed to but Putin rejected, likely due to Russia's steady gains on the battlefield.

          The US said if Ukraine didn't agree to the plan the US would abandon them.
          Zelenskiy said he would not betray Ukraine's interests, warning that Kyiv faces a choice between losing a key partner and its national dignity at one of the most perilous moments in its history.
          The plan comes amid a Ukranian domestic political crisis over a massive corruption probe involving senior officials and business elites.

          On September 9, 2025, Israel launched an airstrike against Hamas leaders in Qatar, who condemned the attack as "cowardly" and called it a flagrant violation of international law.
          Hamas said the Hamas officials in the ceasefire negotiating team survived the attack.
          Israeli officials said the strike was aimed at top Hamas leaders including Khalil al-Hayya, its exiled Gaza chief and top negotiator.
          The attack took place shortly after Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for a shooting that killed six people at a bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem the day before.
          The assault dealt a serious blow to efforts to reach a ceasefire, especially since negotiations took place in Qatar.
          Saudi Arabia called the strike a "brutal Israeli aggression" against Qatar's sovereignty.
          Trump said he was "very unhappy about every aspect" of the Israeli strike, saying "I'm not thrilled about it."
          Two U.S. officials said the U.S. military had been notified by Israel shortly before the strike but there was no coordination with or approval from Washington.
          Qatar is a major non-NATO ally of Washington and host to al-Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East; it is also where Hamas has long had its political base.

        <li><u>Genocide</u>
          On September 16, 2025, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza and that officials including Netanyahu, former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog incited these acts.
          The U.N. report cites examples of the scale of the killings, aid blockages, forced displacement and the destruction of a fertility clinic to back up its genocide finding.
          Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Daniel Meron, called the report "scandalous" and "fake", saying it had been authored by "Hamas proxies".
          The commission's 72-page legal analysis is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the United Nations.
          The 1948 U.N. Genocide Convention defines genocide as crimes committed "with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such".
          To count as genocide, at least one of five acts must have occurred, the commission found that Israel had committed four of them: killing; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians in whole or in part; and imposing measures intended to prevent births.

          Israel says that up to 3,000 Hamas fighters are still in the city and that they estimated 40% of people in Gaza City had left. 
          Trump sided with Israel, telling reporters Hamas would have "hell to pay" if it used hostages as human shields during the assault.
          Alternatively, the EU said it would impose new sanctions on Israel, including suspending certain trade provisions.
          Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, at a meeting Netanyahu convened with security chiefs prior to the assault, urged the prime minister to pursue a ceasefire deal, expressing concern that the Gaza City assault could endanger remaining hostages held by Hamas or be a "death trap" for troops.

          September 30, 2025: Trump proposed a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70155nked7o" target="_blank">20-point Gaza peace plan</a> that included an immediate ceasefire, an exchange of all hostages held by Hamas for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a staged Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the disarmament of Hamas and the introduction of a transitional government led by an international body.
          Netanyahu immediately accepted the plan and Trump said Hamas had 2-4 days to agree to it.
          Hamas faced considerable pressure to accept the plan, with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt all welcoming the initiative.

          On September 2, 2025, the U.S. military killed 11 people in a strike on a speedboat from Venezuela that Trump alleged was carrying illegal narcotics, in the first known operation since Trump's recent deployment of warships to the southern Caribbean.
          In the days before, Trump sent seven U.S. warships, along with one nuclear-powered fast attack submarine to the Caribbean carrying more than 4,500 sailors and Marines.
          The U.S. military had identified the crew as members of Tren de Aragua, without providing evidence, which the U.S. designated a terrorist group in February.
          Venezuela's Communications Minister, Freddy Nanez, suggested that a video shared by Trump of the strike was created with artificial intelligence (the video wasn't AI).
          Experts questioned whether the decision to summarily kill people merely on suspicion of smuggling drugs violated international law, since trafficking illegal substances is not normally considered a capital offence.
          A week after the strike, the Trump admin still had not released any info on the people they executed or briefed lawmakers on the operation.

          The disclosure about the F-35s came just hours after the Pentagon accused Venezuela of a "highly provocative" flight by two Venezuelan F-16s that flew over the guided missile destroyer Jason Dunham warship deployed to the Caribbean.
          Venezuelan President Maduro accused Trump of attempted 'regime change' with Trump denying the allegations and repeating the false narrative that Maduro is controlling TdA.
          Hegseth told sailors and Marines on a warship off Puerto Rico that they were not deployed to the Caribbean for training but instead sent to the "front lines" of a critical counter-narcotics mission.

          IMF was also involved in the talks, which has a $20 billion loan program with Argentina.
          Bessent insisted that the action was not a bailout, saying that no money was transferred to Buenos Aires and the ESF "has never lost money, it's not going to lose money here."
          He added that the assistance provided strategic U.S. benefits, including pledges by Argentina's right-wing president, Javier Milei, of "getting China out of Argentina" and its openness to allow U.S. companies to develop its rare earths and uranium resources.
          The backstop is partly aimed at giving Milei's party a boost in Argentina's October 26 midterm legislative elections, with his party wanting to strengthen its minority position to solidify his agenda to cut government spending and boost private-sector investment.

          He also said Brussels had shut down social media over hateful content, and criticized Germany for what he described as raids against its own citizens for posting anti-feminist comments, Sweden for convicting a Christian activist, and United Kingdom for backsliding on religious rights.
          He specifically targeted the December cancellation of Romania's elections, which were annulled by the country's top court after accusations of Russian meddling, dismissing worries of disinformation as "ugly Soviet-era words".

          On August 4, 2025, rubio sent a State Department cable which instructed US diplomats in Europe to launch a lobbying campaign to build opposition to the EU's Digital Service Act (DSA), which Washington says restricted free speech.
          The EU's DSA is a landmark law meant to make the online environment safer and fairer by compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.
          The order to US diplomats marks an acceleration of the Trump admin's efforts to promote what it calls "America's free speech tradition".
          Rubio's directive takes particular aim at the DSA's description of illegal content, saying it was expansive, and told U.S. diplomats to advocate to get the definition of "illegal content" narrowed so that it would not curb freedom of expression, including in political and religious discourse.
          Another suggestion was to withdraw or amend the DSA'a Code of Conduct on Disinformation, which the State Department said was setting "overly broad controls" on content in a way that was undermining freedom of expression.
          Other talking points included removing or reducing fines for non-compliance to content restrictions, and not relying on "trusted flaggers", entities designated by national authorities to report illegal online content to platforms.

          In July 2025, Ethiopia declared the project complete, with Egypt and Sudan opposing the dam.
          During his first term, Trump tried to broker a deal between Ethiopia and Egypt but couldn't get them to agree and then suspended aid to Ethiopia over the dispute. 
          In July, he said he helped the "fight over the massive dam (and) there is peace at least for now."

          Tensions continued growing since May, when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thai politics.
          Both countries agreed in late July to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia. 
          Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had pressed for the pact, but there was little headway until Trump intervened saying that he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that the U.S. would not move forward with trade agreements if the hostilities continued. 
          Both countries faced economic difficulties and neither had reached tariff deals with the U.S., so they were forced into a ceasefire.

          In June 2025, Trump has played a key role in peace efforts between the African neighbors, when the Congolese and Rwandan foreign ministers signed a peace deal at the White House. 
          However, the M23 wasn't directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and said it couldn't abide by the terms of an agreement that didn't involve it.
          The final step to peace was meant to be a separate Qatar-facilitated deal between Congo and M23 but the deadline for the Qatar-led deal was missed and there have been no public signs further talks between the two as fighting rages on.

        <li><u>Azerbaijan and Armenia</u>
          On August 8, 2025, Azerbaijan and Armenia signed a U.S.-brokered peace agreement in a significant accomplishment for the Trump admin in a region seen in Russia's sphere of influence.
          Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. 
          Azerbaijan took back full control of the region in 2023, prompting almost all of the territory's 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee to Armenia.
          Trump said the two countries had committed to stop fighting, open up diplomatic relations and respect each other's territorial integrity.
          The agreement includes exclusive U.S. development rights to a strategic transit corridor through the South Caucasus that the White House said would facilitate greater exports of energy and other resources.
          Trump said the United States signed separate deals with each country to expand cooperation on energy, trade and technology.
          He said restrictions had also been lifted on defense cooperation between Azerbaijan and the United States, a development that could also worry Moscow.
          Both leaders praised Trump for helping to end the conflict and said they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.
          Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert and adviser to Loyola University's Chicago School of Law, said "The Caucasus has been a blind spot in sanctions policy," and "A formal peace creates a platform for the West to engage Armenia and Azerbaijan ... to shut down the evasion pipelines."

                    <li>The NCAA had long prohibited student-athletes from receiving compensation for athletics outside of scholarships in a bid to preserve the amateurism of college sports and keep the playing field fair for recruiting.
                      However, in June 2021, the organization approved an interim policy allowing college athletes to make money by selling their name, image and likeness (NIL) rights.
                      The policy allowed student athletes to make money through activities such as signing autographs, endorsing products or businesses, and making personal appearances.
                      In March 2025, the NCAA agreed to permanently eliminate its rule that prohibited student athletes from negotiating NIL deals before enrolling in a school.
                      The change came a day after a legal settlement between the NCAA and a group of state attorneys general who had sued the organization, arguing that the restriction violated federal antitrust law.
                      Experts say the problem is that the NCAA and athletic conferences that govern top sports "have stubbornly refused to grant employment status and collective bargaining to athletes."

                    In the test, children have to run and perform situps, pullups or pushups and a sit-and-reach test, but in 2012 it evolved into the Youth Fitness Program, which the Obama admin said "moved away from recognizing athletic performance to providing a barometer on student's health."
                    Then-first lady Michelle Obama also promoted her "Let's Move" initiative focused on reducing childhood obesity through diet and exercise.

                    Asset managers welcomed the news, saying it was a major step toward modernizing retirement savings.
                    BlackRock, which lobbied the Trump administration to expand asset options, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets in 2026.
                    The new investment options carry lower disclosure requirements and are generally less easy to sell quickly for cash than the publicly traded stocks and bonds that most retirement funds rely on and they also tend to carry higher fees.
                    Many private equity firms are hungry for the new source of cash that retail investors could offer after three years in which high interest rates shook their time-honored model of buying companies and selling them at a profit.
                    However, private equity firms said the industry may seek litigation reform before it can expand into the market.
                    The Department of Labor issued similar guidance during Trump's first term but few took advantage, fearing litigation.

                      "Reputational risk" is when banks could sanction institutions for activities that are not strictly prohibited but could expose the bank to negative publicity or costly litigation.
                      Banks increasingly complained the reputational risk standard was too subjective and vague, allowing bank supervisors to effectively bar firms from providing services to some people or sectors.

                    Musk has repeatedly complained that environmental impact studies, post-flight mishap investigations and licensing reviews required by the FAA have needlessly slowed testing of SpaceX's Starship rocket.
                    In early 2025, the FAA grounded Starship test flights for nearly two months after back-to-back post-launch explosions rained debris over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to change course.

                    Cashless bail is when defendants are released from jail while awaiting trial based on their promise to appear in court, rather than by paying a specific cash amount.
                    Under the policy, a judge assesses whether a defendant should be released from jail based on their risk of not showing up for trial.
                    Critics say it reduces the incentive for defendants to show up for trial and puts public safety at risk by allowing them back on the street.
                    Supporters say many low-income people can't afford to post bond.
                    A 2024 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice that looked at 22 cities that enacted bail reform, including cashless bail, and 11 that did not between 2015 and 2021 found no evidence of a link to overall crime trends or specific crimes like violent crime and larceny.
                    Cashless bail is a good idea in theory if paired with strong risk assessments and judicial discretion. 
                    A blanket release policy is bad, but a structured system that detains the truly dangerous while releasing low-risk defendants is more just and still protects public safety.

                    CBO estimated 10 million people on Medicaid will lose coverage due to the bill.
                    The changes include Medicaid eligibility checks twice a year instead of once and 80-hour per month work requirements to receive Medicaid if between ages 19-64.
                    Also replaces the current 6% cap on provider tax revenue (which is collected by states not federally) with a new limit that is indexed to inflation, which indirectly reduces provider taxes.
                    But the bill also sets up a $50 billion rural hospital fund to help rural providers who have argued that the provider tax changes would force them to scale back service.
                    The bill also removes Medicaid eligibility for some non-citizens, including refugees, certain abused spouses and children, and people granted asylum.
                    Also requires states to impose mandatory cost-sharing on expansion enrollees earning more than 100% of the federal poverty level (up from an optional co-pay for above 150% of the poverty level).

                    Since 1992, the USDA has spent $9 billion on SNAP-Ed and drew more than 1.8 million people in 2022.
                    Republican lawmakers argued SNAP-Ed was ineffective and redundant, pointing to a 2019 GAO report that found gaps in how the USDA coordinated and assessed its nutrition program.
                    But the USDA addressed many of those concerns in recent years, according to SNAP-Ed officials.

                    Nonpartisan analysts have found that the wealthiest Americans will see the biggest benefits from the bill, while lower-income people would effectively see their incomes drop as the safety-net cuts would outweigh their tax cuts.

                    On September 11, the First U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals put on hold the injunction, allowing the Medicaid cuts to go into effect while the case continues.
                    December 2: Judge Talwani issues preliminary injunction in different lawsuit that was brought by 22 states that sued, blocking the provision in the bill that bars Medicaid funding for tax-exempt organizations that provide family planning and reproductive health services if they perform abortions and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid funds during the 2023 fiscal year.
                    December 12: 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Tawlani's injunction.

          Trump pardoned all but 14 of the 1,590 people involved in the Jan 6 Capitol riots, including those who assaulted police officers, and those with charges from low-level trespassing offenses to seditious conspiracy.
          The 14 rioters not fully pardoned, all members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, had their sentences commuted and were freed from federal prison.
          Trump also ordered the Attorney General to drop all pending cases related to the riot.
          The White House released a proclamation for the pardons, calling the investigation a "grave national injustice" and saying the pardons would begin a "process of national reconciliation."
          Many Trump allies, including Vice President JD Vance, did not expect such broad pardons.
          The decision was criticized by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the largest police union in the US.
          Craig Sicknick, brother of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick (who died after Jan 6), called Trump "pure evil."
          A Reuters poll found that 60% of Americans say Trump should not have pardoned all the rioters.
          Among those released were Stewart Rhodes (Oath Keepers leader, sentenced to 18 years, sentence commuted) and Enrique Tarrio (Proud Boys leader, sentenced to 22 years, sentence commuted).
          After the pardons, a federal judge briefly imposed restrictions on Rhodes and 7 other Oath Keepers, but dropped them after finding the pardons also released them from court supervision.
