      <h3>Immigration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Birthright Citizenship</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US.
          A day after the EO, 22 Dem-led states, the District of Columbia, and the city if San Fransisco sued Trump in Boston and Seattle and the American Civil Liberties Union immigrant organization also filed seperate lawsuits, both of which said Trump's order violated the 14th amendment.  
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/lawsuits-challenge-trumps-birthright-citizenship-other-orders-2025-01-21/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          Opponents of birthright citizenship say that if the drafters of the 14th amendment wanted all people born in the US to be citizens they would not have said that citizens "be subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
          They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and, by implication, their children.
          However, most scholars dismiss the interpretation, since people in the country illegally are still subject to the laws of the US and are thus "subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-birthright-citizenship-can-trump-end-it-2025-01-21/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On January 23, a Seattle US District judge, John Coughenour, blocked the order from being enforces for 14 days while the judge considers a long-term ruling. 
          Coughenour said the order was "blatantly unconstitutional," referring to the 14th amendment that says any person born in the US is a citizen under the Citizenship Clause.  
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-hear-states-bid-block-trump-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-01-23/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On Febrary 6, Coughenour extended his order, setting a nationwide injunction, saying Trump was ignoring the rule of law.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-accuses-trump-ignoring-rule-law-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-02-06/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          Trump later appealed the order but was denied on Feb 19, 2025.

          On Febrary 5, a second federal judge from a US District court in Maryland issued a nationwide order blocking Trump from implementing the birthright citizenship EO until the court had ruled on a lawsuit brought to the judge by the CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project immigrant rights groups and 5 pregnant women.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/second-us-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-02-05/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
          Trump appealed the Maryland court order but was denied on February 28.

          On Febrary 10, a third U.S. District Judge, Joseph Laplante, in Concord blocked Trump's birthright EO, saying he expects the issue to be brought to the Supreme Court.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-order-curtailing-us-birthright-citizenship-blocked-by-third-judge-2025-02-10/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
          On March 13, Trump asked the Supreme Court to narrow the 3 orders against him and that the injunctions should be scaled back from applying universally and should be limited to just the plaintiffs that brought the cases and are "actually within the courts' power."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-intervene-bid-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-03-13/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
          On June 27, the SC ruled 6-3 ordering the 3 lower courts to narrow their nationwide rulings but specified that Trump's EO cannot take effect until 30 days from then.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-may-rule-allowing-enforcement-trump-birthright-citizenship-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>
          On July 10, Judge Joseph Laplante issued another nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order, despite the Supreme Court's ruling, after the ACLU refiled the case as a class action.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-weigh-blocking-trump-birthright-citizenship-despite-supreme-court-ruling-2025-07-10/" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>Asylum Ban</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed a proclamation, blocking all migrants "engaged in the invasion across the southern border" from claiming asylum. 
          On July 2, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss blocked the proclamation, saying neither federal immigration law nor the U.S. Constitution gave Trump the authority to disregard existing laws and regulations governing the asylum process even if stopping illegal immigration presented "enormous challenges."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-asylum-ban-us-mexico-border-says-he-exceeded-authority-2025-07-02/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>TPS</u> 
          In 2021, Biden granted TPS to Venezuelans, citing high levels of crime in Venezuela due to instbaility from Maduro.
          On Mar 31, 2025, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco paused a DHS decision to remove temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezualans.
          600,000 Venezualans in the US have TPS, the ruling protects 348,000 of them.
          In the ruling, Chen said "Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes."
          Venezuelan TPS holders are more likely to hold bachelor's degrees than U.S. citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general U.S. population.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-blocks-trump-administration-stripping-deportation-protections-venezuelans-2025-03-31/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On April 18, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to pause Chen's TRO while they considered the case, due to the Trump admin not showing it would suffer irreparable harm from the TRO.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/court-rejects-trump-bid-end-venezuelan-migrants-legal-status-2025-04-18/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On May 19, the Supreme Court paused Chen's TRO while the appeals court considers the case (Jackson was the only one to publicly dissent), allowing Trump to move ahead with ending TPS for Venezuelans.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-lets-trump-end-deportation-protection-venezuelans-2025-05-19/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On June 24, Noem said the 521,000 Haitians granted TPS under Biden will have their status terminated on September 2 (original date she set in February was for Aug 2).
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-end-deportation-relief-haitian-migrants-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          On July 1, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn blocked Noem's Hatian TPS revokation, saying "Secretary Noem does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation," making her actions "unlawful."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-ending-temporary-protected-status-haitians-2025-07-01/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
          On July 7, Trump said he would be ending TPS for 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans on September 6, despite many of the migrants having been living and working in the US for decades.
          The migrants from both countries had come to the US under TPS after the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, but Trump said TPS was overused and that many immigrants no longer merit protections.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-terminate-deportation-protection-thousands-hondurans-nicaraguans-us-2025-07-07/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
          On July 14, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted an administrative stay on Trump's termination of TPS for Afghans and Cameroons until July 21.
          The DHS originally set TPS termination for Afghans on July 14, while that of Cameroonians was set to end on August 4.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-temporarily-stays-termination-afghans-protected-status-2025-07-15/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT</u>
          On March 16, 2025, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said that 238 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua had arrived to the Terrorism Confinement Center mega-prison.
          CECOT is notorious for its poor conditions, including overcrowding, overheating, torture, beatings, strangulation, and lack of medical attention.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-removes-hundreds-alleged-venezuelan-gang-members-under-now-blocked-authority-2025-03-16/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          The deportations came despite Boasberg's TRO from the day before, where he said any deportation flights that had already taken off should turn arround and come back to the US.
          "Oopsie...Too late," Bukele posted in response to an article about the TRO blocking the deportations, adding a laughing emoji.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/group-seeks-answers-deportation-venezuelans-despite-court-order-2025-03-17/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          The day before, Trump had agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison 300 alleged members of Tren de Aragua for one year.
          WH press secretary Karoline Leavitt said "A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft ... full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil."
          Border czar Tom Homan later told Fox & Friends "Another flight, another flight every day," adding: "We're not stopping. I don't care what the judges think." 
          Trump said on Truth Social "I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do," and "This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED."
          <sup>

          </sup>
          Trump's comments caused Chief Justice Roberts to publicly rebuke Trump, "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-chief-justice-roberts-calls-judges-impeachment-are-inappropriate-after-trump-2025-03-18/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          On July 18, the 252 Venezuelans held in CECOT were freed to Venezuela in a deal for 10 Americans held in Venezuela being returned to the US.
          The deal also included the release of 80 domestic political prisoners in Venezuela according to US officials.

        </li>
        <li><u>Military Use</u>
          In June 2025, Trump sent 700 DoD personnel to support ICE in Florida, Louisiana and Texas and 700 Marines to LA during immigration protests.
          In July, he sent 200 more Marines to Florida to support ICE.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-military-says-200-marines-being-sent-support-ice-florida-2025-07-03/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>Immigrant Data Sharing</u>
          On April 8, 2025, the head of the IRS, Melanie Krause, and several other top IRS officials resigned after making a deal with the DHS to provide IRS data for immigration crackdowns.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-irs-chief-quit-over-deal-share-data-with-immigration-officials-report-says-2025-04-08/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On July 17, the HHS agreed to begin giving the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees to ICE to help in their immigration crackdown.
          Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states. 
          Illegal immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid under federal law, but 14 states and the District of Columbia provide coverage for eligible children regardless of immigration status, and seven states and DC do so for adults.

        </li>
        <li><u>Third Country Deportations</u>
          On March 28, 2025, US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued a nationwide TRO designed to protect migrants subject to final orders of removal from being swiftly deported to countries other than those that had already been identified during immigration proceedings.
          The National Immigration Litigation Alliance brought the case against Trump after ICE began using a fast-tracked deportation system.
          Murphy said that under the Convention Against Torture, migrants had protections against being removed to countries where they face a likelihood of torture.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-blocks-trump-administration-fast-tracking-deportations-2025-03-28/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On April 7, an appeals court rejected Trump's bid to have Murphy's TRO lifted, saying that such an order generally cannot be appealed, unlike longer-term preliminary injunctions.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-appeals-court-rejects-trump-bid-fast-track-migrant-deportations-2025-04-07/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On April 18, Murphy issued a preliminary injunction, barring Trump from conducting final order deportations without giving the deportees asylum hearings to ensure they would not be tortured or killed.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-trump-policy-speed-deportations-cannot-be-implemented-us-judge-rules-2025-04-18/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On May 7, US District Judge Brian Murphy issued an order restricting Trump from deporting migrants to Libya, despite Libya's harsh treatment of detainees.
          Murphy said the deportations would clearly violate his prior court order barring officials from swiftly deporting migrants to countries other than their own without first weighing whether they risk persecution or torture if sent there.
          When asked about the deportations, Trump said he didn't know anything about them, "You'll have to ask Homeland Security."
          Libya's Government of National Unity said it rejected the use of Libyan territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent and there was no coordination with the US on the issue. 
          Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army, which controls eastern Libya, also rejected the idea.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-may-soon-deport-migrants-libya-military-flight-sources-say-2025-05-07/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          On May 16, the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to stay Murphy's order.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-trump-policy-speed-deportations-cannot-be-implemented-us-judge-rules-2025-04-18/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
          On May 21, Murphy ordered Trump not to deport eight migrants convicted of serious crimes including homicides to South Sudan, saying it would be a violation of his court order.
          Later the same day, Murphy ruled that Trump violated his court order by attempting to deport migrants to South Sudan, saying government officials risked being held in contempt of court.
          Murphy said the DHS failed to provide six migrants covered by his injunction a meaningful opportunity to contest being sent to South Sudan when it notified them of that possibility less than 24 hours before they were loaded onto a plane.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-official-says-us-seeking-deport-eight-serious-criminals-declines-confirm-2025-05-21/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
          On June 23, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to pause Murphy's PI, in an unsigned opinion offering no reasoning.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-lifts-limits-deporting-migrants-countries-not-their-own-2025-06-23/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>
          After the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump sent eight migrants from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam to South Sudan.
          The admin also began pressuring five African nations - Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon - to accept deportees from elsewhere.
          On July 13, an ICE memo said they will only give immigrants six hours notice before deporting them to third countries (was previously 24-hours).
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ice-may-deport-migrants-countries-other-than-their-own-with-just-six-hours-2025-07-13/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
          On July 15, the Trump admin sent a flight of illegal immigrants to Eswatini, with DHS naming five deportees from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen and said they were convicted of crimes ranging from child rape to murder.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-says-it-has-sent-third-country-deportees-southern-africas-eswatini-2025-07-16/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>

        <li><u>Wrongful Deportations</u>
          <ul>
            <li><u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u>: 
              In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
              In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
              The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-judge-hear-lawsuit-man-deported-el-salvador-error-2025-04-04/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
              On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-sidelines-doj-lawyer-after-judge-orders-return-man-deported-erroneously-2025-04-06/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
              On April 7, ahead of the deadline, Chief Justice Roberts issued a stay on Xinis' order while they considered the case, after an appeals court refused to pause the TRO for Trump. 
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-facing-monday-deadline-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man-el-salvador-2025-04-07/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
              On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
              In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful.

              </sup>
              On April 11, Xinis ordered Trump to give daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia, saying the Trump admin has "done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia." 
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-orders-trump-administration-advise-its-steps-return-wrongly-deported-2025-04-11/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
              In the coming days, the Trump admin said Abrego was "alive and secure" but that SC's order to "facilitate" the return of him meant they should only "remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here."
              <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-state-department-says-deported-maryland-resident-alive-secure-el-salvador-2025-04-13/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
              On April 14, 2025, Trump met with El Salvador president Bukele, during the visit, Bukele said he would not return Abrego Garcia and Trump said he would not ask for him back, with both justifying saying Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.
              During the meeting, Pam Bondi said that "facilitate" meant they would just provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia to the US, she also claimed Kilmar had been given a deportation order twice, when he had never been given one.

          However, ICE arrests for those with no criminal record rose from 860 in Jan 2025 to 7,800 in June 2025.
          Between Oct 2024-May 2025, there were 177,000 ICE arrests, with 62,400 of those having prior criminal records (mostly traffic stops or illegal re-entry).

          On June 14, 2025, Trump himself issued an order to ICE to pause raids on farms, hotels, restaurants and meatpacking plants, due to Trump not being aware of the extent of the enforcement push and "once it hit him, he pulled it back."

          In her ruling, Frimpong said the administration was violating the Fourth and Fifth Amendments to the Constitution by conducting "roving patrols" to sweep up suspected undocumented immigrants based on their being Latinos, and then denying them access to lawyers.

        <li><u>Immigrants and Welfare</u>
          Illegal aliens generally do not qualify for federal benefits except for emergency medical care.
          Under a 1982 Supreme Court ruling, all children regardless of immigration status are entitled to a free K-12 education.
          On February 19, 2025, Trump's signed executive order "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders" aimed to target a Biden policy of using the parole authority to temporarily allow illegal immigrants into the US including 900,000 from the Mexico border, 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew, and 300,000 from Ukraine and Afghanistan.
          Those granted parole for at least a year are "qualified non-citizens," making them eligible for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (child coverage if you make too much for Medicaid), but only after 5 years

          On July 10, Trump expanded the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which bans federal benefits for immigrants from 31 programs, to include 13 new programs, bringing the total of programs to 44.
          The law did not define what programs count as "federal public benefits," leaving the interpretation up to federal agencies.
          The newly added banned programs included the Head Start preschool programs for low-income children, various grants or programs for substance use recovery and prevention, the Title X Family Planning Program, health workforce programs, and projects for helping people transition from homelessness.

          On June 9, 2025, Trump sent 2000 National Guard troops to help quell protests that had been going on for 3 days in LA in response to various ICE raids.
          Gavin Newsom called Trump's deployment unlawful and requested their withdrawl.
          Trump used Section 12406 of Title 10 that allows the deployment of the National Guard into federal service if the U.S. is invaded, there is a "rebellion or danger of rebellion" or the president is "unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."
          During the protests, multiple Waymo cars were set on fire and protestors threw concrete and bottles at LAPD officers.
          Eventually the LAPD declared all of downtown LA to be an unlawful assembly.

          LA Mayor Karen Bass said 100 people were arrested after cars were set on fire and several businesses were looted including an Apple store and a CVS pharmacy, she but that most of the protestors were non-violent.
          During the night of June 10, Bass imposed a curfew for 8pm on downtown LA after more lootings took place.

          On March 12, 2025, US District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan in DC ruled that FLRA members may only be removed "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office," and rejected Trump's defense that these protections were unconstitutional.
          The decision gives the FLRA a 2-1 Democratic majority until her term expires in July.
          Sooknanan said Trump's move had undermined Congress' goal of insulating the FLRA from politics.
          A DOJ lawyer at a hearing did not deny that Trump violated the law, but argued that the restrictions on the removal of FLRA members are unconstitutional.

          Trump responded to this by saying Powell's termination "cannot come fast enough," while calling for the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates, pressure Powell said he would resist.
          Powell's term ends in May 2026, when Trump will get to appoint a new chair.
          In the coming weeks, Trump threatened that he could fire Powell if he wanted to and replace him with Kevn Warsh (former Fed governor) or Kevin Hassett (Trump econ adviser).

            These engineers include Gavin Klinger, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine.  
            Gavin Klinger is a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Major grad from Berkeley in 2020, he was previously a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks, he also has a substack where he wrote an article "the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies"; Klinger was later found to have retweeted post from Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate in the past.  
            Luke Forritor is a former intern at SpaceX, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for rocket fuel parts, he graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a CS major, he was previously part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll.
            Edward Coristine is only a highschool grad having been enrolled at Northeastern University, he previously spent 3 weeks at Musk's Neuralink last summer, he also previously created 3 tech firms in Connecticut that are valued at $2.4 million by Zillow; it was later disclosed that Coristine had been fired from his previous job at Path Network amid a leaking investigation.

            He did not have a formal conversation with Trump before announcing his exit and his departure was decided "at a senior staff level."
            His exit came a day after he criticized Trump's tax bill, calling it too expensive and a measure that would undermine DOGE.

            The back-and-forth included Trump threatening to cut Tesla/SpaceX contracts (causing Tesla stock to drop 14%) and Musk calling for Trump's impeachment.
            According to WH sources, the breaking point was over personnel: Trump's decision to pull his nomination of Jared Isaacman, Musk's hand-picked candidate to be NASA administrator.

        <li><u>Mass layoffs</u>
          In February 2025, Trump signed an executive order ordering agencies to begin preparation with DOGE for mass layoffs.
          On May 9, US District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco issued a 14 day TRO blocking Trump from doing mass layoffs, saying they would likely require Congressional approval.

          On June 13, Illston issued a TRO fully blocking the State Dept restructuring plan, saying their defense that the plan was made before the Feb RIF EO was false due to recent department documents citing the EO as a reason for the restructuring.

          On July 8, the Supreme Court lifted Illston's order (Jackson was only dissent), saying the Trump admin was "likely to succeed" in its argument that the mass layoffs were legally within his power. 
          The decision cleared one major legal obstacle for Trump but the court noted that it was not assessing the legality of any specific layoff plans at federal agencies and that they could still face legal challenges.

              On July 11, 2025, the State Department began firing more 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service officers.
              The new layoffs brought the total reduction to around 3,000 including the voluntary departures, out of the 18,000 employees in the US.
              Trump's justification for the reduction was his "American First" vision, which included the elimination of top official for civilian security, democracy, and human rights and the closure of some offices that monitored war crimes and conflicts around the world.

              On July 18, the USDA fired 70 contract researchers from 'countries of concern' after a national security review including from Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.
              Most of those dismissed were Chinese post-doctoral researchers on two-year contracts with the agency, and who were already subject to vetting before being hired.

              In late July, the U.S. Forest Service faced criticism from current and former employees who say the DOGE layoffs have left fire teams understaffed.
              Since Trump took office, 5,000 employees, roughly 15% of the USFS workforce, quit or were bought out.
              Brooke Rollins said that the agency was on target to hire 11,300 firefighters by mid July, outpacing hiring over the past three years.
              Some former and current USFS employees claim Trump administration workforce cuts have left firefighter support jobs understaffed, leaving firefighters performing non-firefighting duties like cleaning toilets and mowing lawns, while USFS officials maintain they have sufficient resources and are adequately prepared for the fire season.

          Trump signed the order with a flank of students behind him in school desks.
          The order aimed to leave school policy almost entirely in the hands of states and local boards.
          Trump cannot dismantle the Education Department without Congressional approval, which is unlikely.
          However, he has already promised to fire half of its staff, which would effectively shutter the department.

          Student loan collections were paused in 2020 as relief during COVID.
          At the time of the announcement, 5 million borrowers were in default and 4 million more were late on making payments.
          The DoE said that if defaulters cannot pay, they will have their wages garnished to pay for the loans.

            A week after the order, Marco Rubio issued a waiver for live-saving humanitarian assistance during the 90 day pause, despite the waiver, numerous cases of life-saving aid not being delivered remained, due to a breakdown in communication at USAID from Trump's overhaul.
            Many aid workers erred on the side of caution and closed their aid programs since the US government became unresponsive to them in weather their programs qualified as "life-saving."

          On July 4, 2025, there were catastrophic flash floods in Texas, killing 78 people including 28 children by July 6.
          The epicenter of the flooding was in Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, where 68 of the deaths were.
          The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on July 4.
          Officials said on July 5 that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees.
          On July 6, FEMA was deployed after Trump issued a major disaster declaration.
          DHS Secretary Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a "moderate" flood watch issued on July 3 by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall.
          The floods caused questioning over if Trump's thousands of job cuts at NOAA, the National Weather Service's parent agency, which left many weather offices understaffed, led to the inaccurate rainfall prediction.

          Kennedy said the child who died in April died from "a bacteriological infection" but not measles, a common anti-vax tactic, despite Texas health officials saying measles was the cause.
          Kennedy responded by saying outbreaks were not "unusual" and that there were 16 in 2024, rather than emphasizing the need for vaccination, Kennedy later went on to endorse the vaccine as the best way to prevent measles while still advocating for alt-treatments as well.

          Despite the outbreak, on Mar 11, 2025, RFK Jr went on Hannity and said the MMR vaccine causes "deaths every year," despite there being no recorded deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people.
          Later in April 2025, RFK Jr said that measles is always going to be around since the MMR vaccine wanes quickly, despite the MMR vaccine having 97% lifetime effectiveness after 2 doses.
          In 1963 before the vaccine there were 3-4 million measles cases a year, not it is usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.
          High vaccination rates are important because when 95% of people are vaccinated then the community has herd immunity, which protects people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.

            The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
            Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
            In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
            No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
            Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
            Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
            Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.

          The order paused all prosecutions of Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials while trying to win or retain business in their countries.
          The FCPA prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials.

          This included disbanding the task force responsible for sanctioning Russian oligarchs, firing DOJ officials who prosecuted Trump, firing 17 investigator generals, firing the head of the whistleblowers office, and calling for corruption charges on NY Mayor Adams to be dropped.
          Trump's DOJ also dropped charges on Republican congressman, Jeff Fortenberry, who had been awaiting trial on charges accusing him of lying to the FBI, as well as the 2 Trump aids charges along Trump in his documents case.
          The moves showed Trump's willingness to break from having an apolitical justice system in favor of aligning the DOJ with Trump's political agenda.

          In February 2025, far-right twitter influencers were invited to the White House and provided with binders marked "The Epstein Files: Phase 1" and "Declassified" that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain, leading to internet backlash.
          After the release flopped, in a March TV interview, Bondi claimed the Biden administration "sat on these documents, no one did anything with them," adding: "Sadly these people don't believe in transparency, but I think more unfortunately, I think a lot of them don't believe in honesty."
          On July 7, the DOJ said Epstein didn't have a client list and that no more files related to the wealthy financier's sex trafficking investigation would be made public despite promises from Attorney General Pam Bondi that had raised the expectations of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.
          Bondi suggesting in a Fox News interview earlier that year that such a document was "sitting on my desk" for review.
          FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino have also insisted in television and podcast interviews that the evidence was clear that Epstein had killed himself.
          They also released a video from outside Epstein's jail cell as proof he actually killed himself.
          Bondi cited the existence of "tens of thousands" of videos that she said showed Epstein "with children or child porn" as the reason for no more public releases, despite multiple people who participated in the criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell saying they had not seen and did not know of a trove of recordings along the lines of what Bondi had referenced. 
          Indictments and detention memos also don't allege the existence of video recordings and neither Epstein nor Maxwell were charged with possession of child sex abuse material even though that would have been easier for prosecutors to prove than the sex trafficking counts they faced.

          On June 27, 2025, Trump abruptly cut off trade talks with Canada, saying that Canada's newly enacted digital services tax on U.S. technology firms was "a direct and blatant attack on our country."

          On May 12, 2025, the US and China agreed to a temporary truce in their tariff trade war, after days of talks mediated in Switzerland.
          The deal leaves US tariffs on China at 30% and China tariffs on the US at 10% from May 14 to August 12.

          Also in the deal, Beijing agreed to supply magnets and rare earth minerals in exchange for the US allowing Chinese students in its colleges and universities.

        <li><u>"Liberation Day"</u>
          On April 2, 2025, Trump imposes "reciprocal" tariffs at a base rate of 10% on 50+ countries and with larger tariffs on many of the countries. 
          In response to the tariffs, automaker Stellantis said it would temporarily lay off U.S. workers and close plants in Canada and Mexico, while General Motors said it would increase U.S. production.
          Howard Lutnick and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro both Trump would not back off, and that the tariff increases were not a negotiation.
          However, Trump later said, "The tariffs give us great power to negotiate."
          The Dow dropped 4% (worst since June 2020), the S&P500 dropped 5%, and the Nasdaq fell 6% (worst since March 2020) due to resurging inflation and recession worries.
          For the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.08%, the Nasdaq declined 10.02%, and the Dow fell 7.86%. The Russell 2000 Small Cap Index dropped 9.70%, confirming a bear market.
          Imports to the United States now face an average duty of 22.5%, up from 2.5% in 2024.
          The tariffs also alienated allies in Asia and undercut US strategic efforts to contain China.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          Tariff "calculation": 
          Trump's formula for calculating the tariffs was to take the U.S. goods trade deficit with a country, divide it by that country's exports to the U.S. and turn it into a percentage figure; then cut that figure in half to produce the U.S. "reciprocal" tariff, with a floor of 10%.
          This ended up making the uninhabited volcanic Australian territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic, largely inhabited by penguins, have a 10% tariff.
          This also disproportionately hurt the poorest countries in the world such as Madagascar (47% reciprocal tariff, $500 GDP per capita, $733 million of US exports), Lesotho (50% reciprocal tariff), Cambodia (49% reciprocal tariff).
          These countries are so poor they cannot import any US goods due to them being so expensive (they aren't buying Teslas), so they got punished with the sharpest tariff rates as a result.

          The ruling blocked all Trump tariffs that used the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), a law meant to address "unusual and extraordinary" threats during a national emergency.
          However, they let the tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum remain in place.

          In mid-July, Lesotho declared a national state of disaster due to the "high rates of youth unemployment and job losses" caused by uncertainty surrounding the tariffs.
          Lesotho's liberation day tariffs were originally 50% and Trump's walkback to 10% didn't prevent the economic fallout from the tariffs.
          Lesotho exported $237 million to the US in 2024, mostly textiles for popular brands such as Levi's and Calvin Klein, making up 1/10th of their GDP and 45% of their total exports.
          Previously, in his March 2025 address to Congress, Trump referred to Lesotho as a country "no one has heard of," which Lesotho's FM Lejone Mpotjoane said was "quite insulting."

          By July 12, Trump also sent letters to 9 more trading partners, including Canada, Japan, Brazil, Mexico, and the EU, threatening higher tariffs on August 2.
          The letters were supposed to incentivize more tariff deals, having only secured framework agreements with Britain, China and Vietnam by that point.

        <li><u>The problem with tariffs</u>
            Retaliation: the tariffs cause other countries to retaliate, not buy from the US anymore, dump their US bonds to raise rate on US debt (China has $769 bln and Japan has $1.01 tln)
            <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAl87r02foI&ab_channel=WilliamSpaniel" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            Supply chains: products today take a lot of parts, these parts come from all over the world meaning tariffs will drive up the price of manufacuring massively and cause stagflation.
            <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAl87r02foI&ab_channel=WilliamSpaniel" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            Reduced military spending: if the tariffs cause a recession that will decrease tax revenue, which will decrease defense spending, which will be worse for manufacturing, which is what the tariffs were meant to be for.

            Recession from uncertainty: uncertainty means no investments, which means no sales and no economic growth, with means recession.
            <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAl87r02foI&ab_channel=WilliamSpaniel" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            Recession from lower consumer activity: if consumers think the tariffs with go away in 2029 with a new administration they will wait to spend money, which will cause a recession.
            <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAl87r02foI&ab_channel=WilliamSpaniel" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            Lower trade deficits: if the US is not importing as much then other countries will have less US dollars, which means they will buy less treasury bonds, which means the US debt rate will increase (1% increase in intrest rates means +80B in annual US debt payments).
            <sup><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAl87r02foI&ab_channel=WilliamSpaniel" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            Mistrust of the US: the tariffs included Taiwan and the EU, which are not countries and shows the lack of a plan of caring that went into crafting tariff policy, if people stop trusting the US then the reserve currency status of the US is at stake.
