      <ul>
        <li><u>Birthright Citizenship</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US.
          A day after the EO, 22 Dem-led states, the District of Columbia, and the city if San Fransisco sued Trump in Boston and Seattle and the American Civil Liberties Union immigrant organization also filed seperate lawsuits, both of which said Trump's order violated the 14th amendment.  
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/lawsuits-challenge-trumps-birthright-citizenship-other-orders-2025-01-21/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          Opponents of birthright citizenship say that if the drafters of the 14th amendment wanted all people born in the US to be citizens they would not have said that citizens "be subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
          They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and, by implication, their children.
          However, most scholars dismiss the interpretation, since people in the country illegally are still subject to the laws of the US and are thus "subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-birthright-citizenship-can-trump-end-it-2025-01-21/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On January 23, a Seattle US District judge, John Coughenour, blocked the order from being enforces for 14 days while the judge considers a long-term ruling. 
          Coughenour said the order was "blatantly unconstitutional," referring to the 14th amendment that says any person born in the US is a citizen under the Citizenship Clause.  
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-hear-states-bid-block-trump-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-01-23/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On Febrary 6, Coughenour extended his order, setting a nationwide injunction, saying Trump was ignoring the rule of law.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-accuses-trump-ignoring-rule-law-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-02-06/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          Trump later appealed the order but was denied on Feb 19, 2025.

          On Febrary 5, a second federal judge, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland, issued a nationwide order blocking Trump from implementing the birthright citizenship EO until the court had ruled on a lawsuit brought to the judge by the CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project immigrant rights groups and 5 pregnant women.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/second-us-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-02-05/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
          Trump appealed the Maryland court order but was denied on February 28.

          On Febrary 10, a third U.S. District Judge, Joseph Laplante, in Concord blocked Trump's birthright EO, saying he expects the issue to be brought to the Supreme Court.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-order-curtailing-us-birthright-citizenship-blocked-by-third-judge-2025-02-10/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
          On March 13, Trump asked the Supreme Court to narrow the 3 orders against him and that the injunctions should be scaled back from applying universally and should be limited to just the plaintiffs that brought the cases and are "actually within the courts' power."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-intervene-bid-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-03-13/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
          On June 27, the SC ruled 6-3 ordering the 3 lower courts to narrow their nationwide rulings but specified that Trump's EO cannot take effect until 30 days from then.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-may-rule-allowing-enforcement-trump-birthright-citizenship-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>
          On July 10, Judge Joseph Laplante issued another nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order, despite the Supreme Court's ruling, after the ACLU refiled the case as a class action.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-weigh-blocking-trump-birthright-citizenship-despite-supreme-court-ruling-2025-07-10/" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup>
          On July 23, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to uphold Judge Coughenour's decision, agreeing that Trump was violating the 14th Amendment.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-blocks-trumps-order-curtailing-birthright-citizenship-2025-07-24/" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup>
          On July 25, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston said his earlier nationwide injuction would remain in place despite the Supreme Court ruling.
          Sorokin wrote that the evidence before him "does not support a finding that any narrower option would feasibly and adequately protect the plaintiffs from the injuries they have shown they are likely to suffer if the unlawful policy announced in the Executive Order takes effect during the pendency of this lawsuit."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-reaffirms-nationwide-injunction-blocking-trump-executive-order-2025-07-25/" target="_blank">[13]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>Asylum Ban</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed a proclamation, blocking all migrants "engaged in the invasion across the southern border" from claiming asylum. 
          On July 2, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss blocked the proclamation, saying neither federal immigration law nor the U.S. Constitution gave Trump the authority to disregard existing laws and regulations governing the asylum process even if stopping illegal immigration presented "enormous challenges."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-asylum-ban-us-mexico-border-says-he-exceeded-authority-2025-07-02/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On August 1, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially granted Moss's order, saying Trump's order cannot be used to entirely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers.
          On August 4, the Trump Admin instructed CBP to stop deportations under the asylum ban and process migrants under US migration law.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/border-agents-directed-stop-deportations-under-trumps-asylum-ban-after-court-2025-08-05/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>TPS</u> 
          In 2021, Biden granted TPS to Venezuelans, citing high levels of crime in Venezuela due to instbaility from Maduro.
          On Mar 31, 2025, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco paused a DHS decision to remove temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezualans.
          600,000 Venezualans in the US have TPS, the ruling protects 348,000 of them.
          In the ruling, Chen said "Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes."
          Venezuelan TPS holders are more likely to hold bachelor's degrees than U.S. citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general U.S. population.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-blocks-trump-administration-stripping-deportation-protections-venezuelans-2025-03-31/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On April 18, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to pause Chen's TRO while they considered the case, due to the Trump admin not showing it would suffer irreparable harm from the TRO.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/court-rejects-trump-bid-end-venezuelan-migrants-legal-status-2025-04-18/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On May 19, the Supreme Court paused Chen's TRO while the appeals court considers the case (Jackson was the only one to publicly dissent), allowing Trump to move ahead with ending TPS for Venezuelans.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-supreme-court-lets-trump-end-deportation-protection-venezuelans-2025-05-19/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On June 24, Noem said the 521,000 Haitians granted TPS under Biden will have their status terminated on September 2 (original date she set in February was for Aug 2).
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-administration-end-deportation-relief-haitian-migrants-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          On July 1, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn blocked Noem's Hatian TPS revokation, saying "Secretary Noem does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation," making her actions "unlawful."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-ending-temporary-protected-status-haitians-2025-07-01/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
          On July 7, Trump said he would be ending TPS for 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans on September 6, despite many of the migrants having been living and working in the US for decades.
          The migrants from both countries had come to the US under TPS after the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, but Trump said TPS was overused and that many immigrants no longer merit protections.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-terminate-deportation-protection-thousands-hondurans-nicaraguans-us-2025-07-07/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
          On July 14, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted an administrative stay on Trump's termination of TPS for Afghans and Cameroons until July 21.
          The DHS originally set TPS termination for Afghans on July 14, while that of Cameroonians was set to end on August 4.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-temporarily-stays-termination-afghans-protected-status-2025-07-15/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>Humanitarian Parole</u>
          On July 22, an Afghan interpreter for the U.S. military during the war in Afghanistan, known as Zia, was arrested by ICE after an appointment in Connecticut related to his application for a green card under the humanitarian parole program.
          Zia was in the US legally but the DHS said he was under investigation for a "serious criminal allegation," a judge later issued a temporary stay preventing Zia's removal from the US.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/masked-ice-agents-detain-former-afghan-interpreter-who-helped-us-military-2025-07-22/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On August 1, U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C. said it served the public interest to put on hold the DHS's expedited removals for those who entered with temporary parole, rather than cause irreparable harm to immigrants by allowing them.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-blocks-trump-fast-tracking-deportations-immigrants-paroled-into-us-2025-08-01/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>238 Venezuelans sent to CECOT</u>
          On March 16, 2025, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said that 238 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua had arrived to the Terrorism Confinement Center mega-prison.
          CECOT is notorious for its poor conditions, including overcrowding, overheating, torture, beatings, strangulation, and lack of medical attention.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-removes-hundreds-alleged-venezuelan-gang-members-under-now-blocked-authority-2025-03-16/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          The deportations came despite Boasberg's TRO from the day before, where he said any deportation flights that had already taken off should turn arround and come back to the US.
          "Oopsie...Too late," Bukele posted in response to an article about the TRO blocking the deportations, adding a laughing emoji.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/group-seeks-answers-deportation-venezuelans-despite-court-order-2025-03-17/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          The day before, Trump had agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison 300 alleged members of Tren de Aragua for one year.
          WH press secretary Karoline Leavitt said "A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft ... full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil."
          Border czar Tom Homan later told Fox & Friends "Another flight, another flight every day," adding: "We're not stopping. I don't care what the judges think." 
          Trump said on Truth Social "I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do," and "This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED."
          <sup>

          </sup>
          Trump's comments caused Chief Justice Roberts to publicly rebuke Trump, "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-chief-justice-roberts-calls-judges-impeachment-are-inappropriate-after-trump-2025-03-18/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          On July 18, the 252 Venezuelans held in CECOT were freed to Venezuela in a deal for 10 Americans held in Venezuela being returned to the US.
          The deal also included the release of 80 domestic political prisoners in Venezuela according to US officials.

        </li>
        <li><u>Military Use</u>
          On April 14, 2025, the Trump admin announced an emergency transfer of a 110,000 acre strip of federal land on the US-Mexico border (known as the Roosevelt Reservation) to the US Army as part of a military base.
          Trump did this to use troops to detain migrants without invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act that empowers a president to deploy the U.S. military to suppress events such as civil disorder.
          During Trump's first term, he made a similar move with 560 arces of land in order to build some of his border wall.
          <sup>

          On May 15, US Magistrate Judge Gregory Wormuth dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of migrants caught in the New Mexico military zone, saying they did not know they were entering a military zone and could not be charged.

          On June 5, federal jury in Texas acquitted Peruvian woman Adely Vanessa De La Cruz-Alvarez, the first migrant tried for tresspassing on the new Texas military zone (however they did find her guilty of entering the country illegally).

          In mid June, Trump sent 700 DoD personnel to support ICE in Florida, Louisiana and Texas and 700 Marines to LA during immigration protests.
          In July, he sent 200 more Marines to Florida to support ICE.

        <li><u>Immigrant Data Sharing</u>
          On April 8, 2025, the head of the IRS, Melanie Krause, and several other top IRS officials resigned after making a deal with the DHS to provide IRS data for immigration crackdowns.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-irs-chief-quit-over-deal-share-data-with-immigration-officials-report-says-2025-04-08/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On July 17, the HHS agreed to begin giving the personal data of 79 million Medicaid enrollees to ICE to help in their immigration crackdown.
          Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal government and states. 
          Illegal immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid under federal law, but 14 states and the District of Columbia provide coverage for eligible children regardless of immigration status, and seven states and DC do so for adults.

        <li><u>Third Country Deportations</u>
          On March 28, 2025, US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued a nationwide TRO designed to protect migrants subject to final orders of removal from being swiftly deported to countries other than those that had already been identified during immigration proceedings.
          The National Immigration Litigation Alliance brought the case against Trump after ICE began using a fast-tracked deportation system.
          Murphy said that under the Convention Against Torture, migrants had protections against being removed to countries where they face a likelihood of torture.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-blocks-trump-administration-fast-tracking-deportations-2025-03-28/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On April 7, an appeals court rejected Trump's bid to have Murphy's TRO lifted, saying that such an order generally cannot be appealed, unlike longer-term preliminary injunctions.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-appeals-court-rejects-trump-bid-fast-track-migrant-deportations-2025-04-07/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On April 18, Murphy issued a preliminary injunction, barring Trump from conducting final order deportations without giving the deportees asylum hearings to ensure they would not be tortured or killed.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/new-trump-policy-speed-deportations-cannot-be-implemented-us-judge-rules-2025-04-18/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On May 7, US District Judge Brian Murphy issued an order restricting Trump from deporting migrants to Libya, despite Libya's harsh treatment of detainees.
          Murphy said the deportations would clearly violate his prior court order barring officials from swiftly deporting migrants to countries other than their own without first weighing whether they risk persecution or torture if sent there.
          When asked about the deportations, Trump said he didn't know anything about them, "You'll have to ask Homeland Security."
          Libya's Government of National Unity said it rejected the use of Libyan territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent and there was no coordination with the US on the issue. 
          Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army, which controls eastern Libya, also rejected the idea.

          On May 16, the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to stay Murphy's order.

          On May 21, Murphy ordered Trump not to deport eight migrants convicted of serious crimes including homicides to South Sudan, saying it would be a violation of his court order.
          Later the same day, Murphy ruled that Trump violated his court order by attempting to deport migrants to South Sudan, saying government officials risked being held in contempt of court.
          Murphy said the DHS failed to provide six migrants covered by his injunction a meaningful opportunity to contest being sent to South Sudan when it notified them of that possibility less than 24 hours before they were loaded onto a plane.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-official-says-us-seeking-deport-eight-serious-criminals-declines-confirm-2025-05-21/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
          On June 23, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 to pause Murphy's PI, in an unsigned opinion offering no reasoning.

          After the Supreme Court's ruling, Trump sent eight migrants from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan and Vietnam to South Sudan.
          The admin also began pressuring five African nations - Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon - to accept deportees from elsewhere.
          On July 13, an ICE memo said they will only give immigrants six hours notice before deporting them to third countries (was previously 24-hours).

          On July 15, the Trump admin sent a flight of illegal immigrants to Eswatini, with DHS naming five deportees from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen and said they were convicted of crimes ranging from child rape to murder.

          On August 2, Reuters found that two men from Vietnam, two men from Laos and a man from Mexico were all deported to their home nations after having previously being threatened with deportation to Libya.

        <li><u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u> 
          In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
          In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
          The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).

          On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").

          On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
          In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful.

          After Crenshaw's order, Holmes said she would delay her order for release by at least 30 days.
          On the same day, Judge Xinis ruled that if Abrego is released from criminal custody, ICE could not detain him in Tennessee and that his immigration case must be returned to Maryland, and that he must be notified at least three days before any deportation to a third country.

        <li><u>LA Riots</u>
          On June 9, 2025, Trump sent 2000 National Guard troops to help quell protests that had been going on for 3 days in LA in response to various ICE raids.
          Gavin Newsom called Trump's deployment unlawful and requested their withdrawl.
          Trump used Section 12406 of Title 10 that allows the deployment of the National Guard into federal service if the U.S. is invaded, there is a "rebellion or danger of rebellion" or the president is "unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."
          During the protests, multiple Waymo cars were set on fire and protestors threw concrete and bottles at LAPD officers.
          Eventually the LAPD declared all of downtown LA to be an unlawful assembly.

          On June 10, in a highly unusual use if US military personnel, Trump sent 2000 more Nationa Guard troops and 700 Marines to LA as the protests spread to neighboring Orange County, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Austin.
          LA Mayor Karen Bass said 100 people were arrested after cars were set on fire and several businesses were looted including an Apple store and a CVS pharmacy, she but that most of the protestors were non-violent.
          During the night of June 10, Bass imposed a curfew for 8pm on downtown LA after more lootings took place.

          On July 21, Rubio said certain lawful permanent residents could be deported, saying Washington determined some had supported Haitian gang leaders connected to Viv Ansanm.
          The same day, ICE arrested Pierre Reginald Boulos, an American-born entrepreneur and physician and lawful permanent resident of the U.S. and citizen of Haiti, over alleged engagement in violence and contribution to "destabilization of Haiti."

        <li><u>Judge Boasberg</u>
          On April 17, Boasberg ruled that there was probable cause to believe the government had violated his order to return migrants from El Salvador he had made on Mar 15 and that they could face contempt charges.
          On April 19, an appeals court put on hold Boasberg's threat of contempt charges.
          On June 24, Erez Reuveni, the former DOJ official who was fired after admitting in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, submitted a whistleblower complaint that Bove pressured DOJ attorneys do defy court orders that blocked migrant removals.
          This included Bove telling colleagues in a March 14 meeting they could consider defying future court orders by telling the courts "fuck you" so that Venezuelan and El Salvador bound planes could take off, Bove denied making such statements in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
          On July 10, US Senate Democrats released internal DOJ text messages and emails coroborating the allegations that Bove directed the defiance of court orders.
          In a March 15 text exchange between Reuveni and his supervisor August Flentje (also was at the March 14 Bove meeting) one of them wrote: "Guess it's time to find out on the 'fuck you.'" "Yup. It was good working with you," the other responded.
          The two then discussed how shocked they were that the DOJ had lied to Boasberg about knowing whether flights were due to depart in the next 24 hours.
          "He knows there are plans for (Alien Enemies Act) removals within the next 24 hours," one of them wrote. "Yes he does," the other replied.
          On August 8, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals sided with the government by a 2-1 vote to overturn Boasberg's contempt ruling, saying "The District Court's order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses."

          On July 28, the DOJ filed a misconduct complaint against Judge Boasberg, 
          The DOJ complaint focused on comments Boasberg made during a meeting of the judiciary's top policymaking body in March that was attended by Chief Justice John Roberts in which Boasberg expressed his concern to Roberts and others that the Trump administration would disregard court rulings and trigger "a constitutional crisis."
          The DOJ argued those comments eroded public confidence in judicial neutrality and ran afoul of the judicial code of conduct and accused him of then acting on his belief by issuing his order that blocked the president from using wartime powers to deport Venezuelan migrants.

          On August 7, 2025 Trump ordered the Commerce Department to begin work on a new census that excludes immigrants in the US illegally (next census wasn't for 2030).
          Trump's order revisited a push from his first term in which he added a contentious citizenship question the 2020 census but was later blocked by the Supreme Court which said the federal government gave a "contrived" rationale.
          After taking office, President Biden issued an executive order affirming the long standing practice of including all people residing in a state in the official count but Trump revoke that order on his first day during his second term.
          Republicans argue that excluding immigrants in the US illegally would benefit Republican districts and hurt urban areas, which are often Democrat controlled, with the counter argument being that if you don't count everyone you end up misspending money on infrastructure, hospitals, schools, power grids, and water.

          On March 12, 2025, US District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan in DC ruled that FLRA members may only be removed "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office," and rejected Trump's defense that these protections were unconstitutional.
          The decision gives the FLRA a 2-1 Democratic majority until her term expires in July.
          Sooknanan said Trump's move had undermined Congress' goal of insulating the FLRA from politics.
          A DOJ lawyer at a hearing did not deny that Trump violated the law, but argued that the restrictions on the removal of FLRA members are unconstitutional.

          Powell's term ends in May 2026, when Trump will get to appoint a new chair.

          On July 24, Trump made a rare visit to the Fed to meet Powell amid his continued criticism of the Fed over rates and their renovations.
          Powell typically spends the Thursday afternoon before a rate-setting meeting doing back-to-back calls with Fed bank presidents as part of his preparations for the session.
          During the visit, Trump claimed the renovation project was estimated to cost $3.1 billion, "I am not aware of that," Powell said, shaking his head before Trump handed him a piece of paper, which Powell examined and daid "You just added in a third building," noting that the Martin Building had been completed five years ago.

          On March 27, 2025, Trump signed executive order "Exclusions from Federal Labor-Management Relations Programs" that directs agencies to end collective bargaining with federal unions.
          The EO affected agencies include the Departments of State, Defense, Veterans Affairs, Energy, Health and Human Services, Treasury, Justice and Commerce and the part of Homeland Security, while police and firefighters would continue to collectively bargain.
          Trump said the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 gives him the authority to end collective bargaining with federal unions to safeguard national security.
          Earlier in March, DHS ended a collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of TSA employees.

        <li><u>Head of BLS Fired</u>
          On August 3, Trump fired BLS Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and accused her of faking the jobs numbers following a poor BLS jobs report.
          Hassett defended Trump, saying the main concern was the BLS report of net downward revisions showing 258,000 fewer jobs had been created in May and June than previously reported (-133k in June and -125k in May).
          There was no way a commissioner could rig the jobs numbers, said William Beach, a former BLS commissioner and co-chair of the group Friends of the BLS.
          "Every year we've revised the numbers. When I was commissioner, we had a 500,000 job revision during President Trump's first term," Beach said.
          "And why do we do that? Because firms are created or firms go out of business, and we don't really know that during the course of our of the year, until we reconcile against a real full count of all the businesses."

          On June 13, Illston issued a TRO fully blocking the State Dept restructuring plan, saying their defense that the plan was made before the Feb RIF EO was false due to recent department documents citing the EO as a reason for the restructuring.

          The decision cleared one major legal obstacle for Trump but the court noted that it was not assessing the legality of any specific layoff plans at federal agencies and that they could still face legal challenges.

              On July 11, 2025, the State Department began firing more 1,107 civil service and 246 foreign service officers.
              The new layoffs brought the total reduction to around 3,000 including the voluntary departures, out of the 18,000 employees in the US.
              Trump's justification for the reduction was his "American First" vision, which included the elimination of top official for civilian security, democracy, and human rights and the closure of some offices that monitored war crimes and conflicts around the world.

              One of the departments affected by the reorganization was the Office of Casualty Assistance, which supports U.S. diplomats and their families abroad in the event of death or serious injury, with the entire team receiving termination notices.

              In late July, the U.S. Forest Service faced criticism from current and former employees who say the DOGE layoffs have left fire teams understaffed.
              Since Trump took office, 5,000 employees, roughly 15% of the USFS workforce, quit or were bought out.
              Brooke Rollins said that the agency was on target to hire 11,300 firefighters by mid July, outpacing hiring over the past three years.
              Some former and current USFS employees claim Trump administration workforce cuts have left firefighter support jobs understaffed, leaving firefighters performing non-firefighting duties like cleaning toilets and mowing lawns, while USFS officials maintain they have sufficient resources and are adequately prepared for the fire season.

          The mass firings were also done hastily, with many nuclear workers, bird flu scientists, veterans affairs employees, and hydroelectric dam workers being rehired after being fired.

          The emergency ruling came after DOGE gained access using armed police to the USIP, an independent, nonprofit organization funded by Congress.
          Howell strongly criticized how DOGE had entered the building but said she was not going issue a TRO.
          DOGE had a standoff on March 17 in which a handful of USIP staff locked the doors to the building, after which DOGE and the local police, expelled the USIP's president, several staffers, and an attorney from the building.
          Trump subsequently fired the USIP president and installed a loyalist to replace him.
          Trump had also previously fired most of the USIP board on March 14, which they claimed was unlawful due to Trump not giving a reason for the terminations.

          Musk originally claimed on the campaign trail that he would be able to cut $2 trillion from the deficit due to waste, fraud, and abuse.
          He later revised this to $1 tillion after Trump took office, then to $150 billion a few months into the presidency.
          At the end of May 2025 when Musk left, DOGE claimed $170 billion in savings on their "Wall of Receipts," but this number is disputed due to many of their receipts being riddled with errors.
          According to Treasury data from the time of Jan-May 2025, spent about $250 billion more than the same period the previous year, mostly due to the intrest on debt and Social Security increases.
          Among the agencies DOGE targeted including the State Dept, Dept of Education, USAID, NIH, and the CDC, Treasury data shows their spending was down $19 billion compared to the previous year.
          Also, the BBC did an analysis of the savings and could only verify $32.5 billion in savings due to the remainder of the claimed savings not having receipts attached. 
          CBS also reported that DOGE efforts so far have offsetting costs of $135 billion from rehiring mistakenly fired workers, layoff packages, lawsuits against DOGE, etc.

        <li><u>Associated Press</u>
          On February 12, 2025, Trump barred AP reporters from accessing the Oval Office, where Trump had given almost daily addresses to the press.
          Trump refused to let the AP in because they continued to use the term "Gulf of Mexico" instead of "Gulf of America."
          AP, citing editorial standards, said it would continue to use the gulf's established name.
          Most news organizations, including Reuters, continued to call the body of water the Gulf of Mexico but were not barred like AP.

          On April 8, McFadden ruled that Trump must allow the AP back into the Oval Office and Air Force One, citing the First Amendment.
          McFadden said that Trump had unlawfully retaliated again the AP for their reporting.

          At Trump's first cabinet meeting on February 26, 2025, the WH barred Reuters, the AP, HuffPost, and the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.
          They allowed ABC, Newsmax, Axios, the Blaze, Bloomberg News and NPR to cover the event.
          A group of D.C.-based journalists called the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) had traditionally rotated a pool of news organizations allowed to small space events, but the three wire services, AP, Bloomberg and Reuters, were always permanent members.
          WHCA issued a statement protesting the decision consolidate press coverage power under the WH allowing Trump to choose who will cover him.

          On April 15, Trump removed Bloomberg, Reuters, and the AP from their permanent slot in the WH press pool.
          The pool typically has 10 outlets, that follow the President wherever he goes but Trump is changing it to 30 rotating outlets determined by Karoline Leavitt.
          The three wire services were permanent slot holders due to local news outlets relying on their reporting, due to these local outlets not having a presence in Washington.
          The AP had previously been revomed from the pool due to the Gulf of America spat.

        <li><u>Public Broadcasting</u>
          On August 1, the nonprofit Corporation for Public Broadcasting shut down its operations due to the loss of federal funding from the $9 billion recission package passed by Congress.
          This included the elimination of $1.1 billion earmarked for the CPB (which distributes funding to PBS and NPR) over the next two years.
          Created by the U.S. Congress in 1967, the CPB distributed more than $500 million annually to the PBS, NPR and more than 1,500 locally operated public radio and television stations.

        <li><u>Office of Justice Programs Cuts</u> 
          On April 23, 2025, the DOJ cut 365 grants worth $811 million for supporting crime victims, including for transgender victims; hotlines used by crime victims; grants to fight human trafficking that have gone to organizations working with immigrants; programs to curb juvenile delinquency and safeguard incarcerated youth; and funding for state-run hate-crime reporting. 
          The cuts were authored by Tarak Makecha, a former Tesla employee, who created the list without consulting program managers at the department's Office of Justice Programs.
          Bondi said the cuts reflected the priorities of Trump.
          DOJ grants typically run for 3 years and grant focuses often change from admin to admin, however, grants are rarely cut outright.
          A day after some Reuters reported on the cuts, seven of them were restored including for a program for pet-friendly domestic violence shelters.
          One terminated grant that wasn't restored was $8.3 million to the National Policing Institute, which funded rural police departments and district attorneys' offices to help pay for automated license plate readers, violent crime investigators, investigations against drug dealers for fentanyl overdoses, and programs to combat child sexual abuse.
          Bondi later tweeted examples of "wasteful grants," including a $2 million to "national listening sessions of individuals with lived experience," DOGE quote tweeted with "Great work."
          That $2 million grant trained prosecutors to investigate child abuse in juvenile detention facilities, youth correctional facilities or group homes; the listening sessions allowed prosecutors to hear directly from youth abuse victims.

          On July 29, Reuters revealed that $158 million in the cuts were for federal funding to gun violence prevention programs.
          Of the 145 community violence intervention (CVI) grants totaling more than $300 million awarded through the DOJ, 69 grants were abruptly terminated in April.
          Some critics of CVI argue that the programs aren't effective and that the funding should go to better law enforcement while others view the initiatives as inherently "anti-gun" and are used by NGOs to advocate against gun rights.
          However, in June, a letter signed by 18 law enforcement groups and police chiefs in Louisville, Minneapolis, Tucson and Omaha called on Bondi to reinstate funding that has resulted in "measurable and significant reductions in violence and homicides."

          On August 1, U.S. District Judge John Cronan in Manhattan rejected a bid by 16 Dem states to block the funding cuts.
          Cronan said a challenge to NSF's already-completed grant terminations could not be pursued in his court but instead could only be taken up by the Court of Federal Claims, a specialist court that hears monetary claims against the U.S. government.

          Trump's AI policy shifted from the Biden's approach of considering environmental and equity constraints in favor of a deregulation that only worries about speed.
          Trump's AI policy also marked departure from Biden's "high fence" approach that limited global access to coveted AI chips.
          The AI plan did not address national security concerns around Nvidia's H20 chip, which Trump blocked the export of in April before backtracking in early July.

          Trump signed the order with a flank of students behind him in school desks.
          The order aimed to leave school policy almost entirely in the hands of states and local boards.
          Trump cannot dismantle the Education Department without Congressional approval, which is unlikely.
          However, he has already promised to fire half of its staff, which would effectively shutter the department.

          At the time of the announcement, 5 million borrowers were in default and 4 million more were late on making payments.

          On August 7 Trump signed a memo requiring universities to collect admissions data to prove they are not engaging in an effort to shape their student bodies along racial lines.
          According to the memo, despite the 2023 U.S. Supreme Court affirmative action ruling, universities have skirted the decision by relying on "diversity statements" students provide in applying that indicate their race and the White House now wants schools to show they are complying.

          Following criticism, which was just days after a gunman killed four people inside of Manhattan skyscraper, FEMA parent agency DHS encouraged cities to tap into a separate pool for funding to cover security needs, known as the State Homeland Security Program.

          On July 4, 2025, there were catastrophic flash floods in Texas, killing 78 people including 28 children by July 6.
          The epicenter of the flooding was in Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, where 68 of the deaths were.
          The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on July 4.
          Officials said on July 5 that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees.
          On July 6, FEMA was deployed after Trump issued a major disaster declaration.
          DHS Secretary Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a "moderate" flood watch issued on July 3 by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall.
          The floods caused questioning over if Trump's thousands of job cuts at NOAA, the National Weather Service's parent agency, which left many weather offices understaffed, led to the inaccurate rainfall prediction.

          The most devastating impact of the flooding was at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp, where 27 campers and counselors were among those who perished in the flooding.
          Multiple media outlets reported that Richard "Dick" Eastland, 70, the co-owner and director of Camp Mystic, died trying to save the children at his camp during the flood.

          The same day, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick vowed that the state would "step up" to pay for installing a flash-flood warning system in Kerrville by next summer if local governments "can't afford it."
          Climate experts also placed some blame for the flooding on climate change saying "Climate change loads the dice toward more frequent and more intense floods."

          In April, 2025, the Trump admin announced it would end the BRIC program calling it wasteful, effective, and politicized.
          In response, 20 mostly Democratic led states sued Trump, saying FEMA had approved about $4.5 billion in grants for nearly 2000 projects and that FEMA lacked the power to cancel the BRIC program without congressional approval.
          On August 5, U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston issued a preliminary injunction preventing the government from spending money allocated to the BRIC program for other purposes, saying there was an inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law, and the potential hardship to states from the funds being repurposed far outweighed the minimal hardship to the government.

          Kennedy said the child who died in April died from "a bacteriological infection" but not measles, a common anti-vax tactic, despite Texas health officials saying measles was the cause.
          Kennedy responded by saying outbreaks were not "unusual" and that there were 16 in 2024, rather than emphasizing the need for vaccination, Kennedy later went on to endorse the vaccine as the best way to prevent measles while still advocating for alt-treatments as well.

          Despite the outbreak, on Mar 11, 2025, RFK Jr went on Hannity and said the MMR vaccine causes "deaths every year," despite there being no recorded deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people.
          Later in April 2025, RFK Jr said that measles is always going to be around since the MMR vaccine wanes quickly, despite the MMR vaccine having 97% lifetime effectiveness after 2 doses.
          In 1963 before the vaccine there were 3-4 million measles cases a year, not it is usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.
          High vaccination rates are important because when 95% of people are vaccinated then the community has herd immunity, which protects people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.

          On May 1, Kennedy also said that the MMR vaccines contain aborted fetal debris (which they do not, rubella vaccine was first produced from a fetal cell line in the 1960s) and that the mumps vaccine didn't work (despite having 86% effectivness).

            The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
            Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
            In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
            No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
            Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
            Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
            Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/why-are-autism-rates-rising-2025-01-14/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>

          "To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we're prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don't collapse when viruses mutate,"" Kennedy said.
          "I don't think I've seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business," said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations, noting that mRNA technology offers potential advantages of rapid production, crucial in the event of a new pandemic that requires a new vaccine.
          According to experts, Kennedy's claims ignore how mRNA vaccines work, where he's misguided is that vaccines aim to prevent severe infection and death, not to completely protect from infection in the first place.

        <li><u>Eric Adams</u> 
          On February 10, 2025, Bove directed federal prosecutors to drop all corruption charges on NY Mayor Eric Adams, saying the case was impeding his ability to aid Trump on immigration.
          Bove said he didn't question the integrity of the prosecutors who brought the case and had no doubts on the merit of it but said he endorsed the idea that the charges were only brought on Adams because he critisiced Biden's immigration policy.
          Bove said he wanted the charges dropped "without prejudice," so that they could possibly be revived again after the upcoming NY mayoral election amounting to an implicit threat of future prosecution if Adams didn't play ball.
          Adams was federally indicted (means he most likely is guilty) in Sept 2024 for accepting bribes from Turkish officials in exchange for taking pro-Turkey actions.
          Following Adams' indictment, he began forging ties with Trump, inlcuding attending his inaguration at Maralago, leading many to believe he was seeking a pardon.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/justice-department-seeks-dismissal-charges-against-new-york-mayor-ny-times-says-2025-02-10/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On February 13, in the first large controntation in the new Trump presidency, the Manhattan US Attorney, Dannielle Sassoon resigned after rejecting to comply with Bove's order to drop charges on Adams.
          After Sassoon had rejected dismissing the case, Trump's admin directed John Keller, the acting head of the Justice Department's public corruption unit, to do so.
          However, Keller also resigned along with Kevin Driscoll, a senior official in the department's criminal division, three other deputies in the DOJ public corruption unit also resigned.
          Sassoon was picked by Trump to temporarily lead the office prosecuting Adams, she is also a member of the right-leaning Federalist Society and a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
          Sassoon also said she would seek a new indictment accusing Adams of destroying evidence and directing others to do so.
          Bove responded by saying that Sassoon had failed to comply with what he called his office's finding that the case against Adams amounted to "weaponization" of the justice system, saying the DOJ would "not tolerate the insubordination."
          Bove said that the two trial prosecutors on Adam's case would be put on leave and his office would take over the case, moving to dismiss it.
          In a letter to Bondi, Sassoon wrote that she and Bove attended a meeting on Jan 31 in which Adams' lawyers said they mayor could only enforce immigration policies if his charges were dropped, Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, denied any "quid pro quo." 
          The resignations were compared to the "Saturday Night Massacre" in 1973, when senior DOJ officials resigned after refusing Nixon's order to fire the special counsel investigating break-in at the Watergate Democratic headquarters.

          In June 2025, CBS parent company Paramount settled a $16 million lawsuit filed by Trump over a 60-minutes interview with Kamala Harris from October 2024 that Trump claimed was edited deceptively in order to swing the 2024 election.
          Paramount said the money would go to Trump's presidential library.
          The settlement came amid Paramount Global's, the parent company of CBS, bid seeking approval from the FTC for an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.
          Steven Colbert, who hosts CBS's "The Late Show", called the settlement a "big fat bribe" on his show.
          On July 17, CBS cancelled Colbert's show, citing financial reasons.
          On July 24, the FCC approved in a 2-1 vote the $8.4 billion merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media.
          The commission received pledges from Skydance that it would appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of editorial bias or other concerns about CBS and Skydance also told the FCC it would not establish any DEI initiatives.

        <li><u>Pausing FCPA</u>
          In a February 10, 2025 executive order, Trump ordered the federal government to stop enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
          The order paused all prosecutions of Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials while trying to win or retain business in their countries.
          The FCPA prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials.
          Goldman Sachs, Glencore, and Walmart have all faced scrutiny over the FCPA in the past.

          This included disbanding the task force responsible for sanctioning Russian oligarchs, firing DOJ officials who prosecuted Trump, firing 17 investigator generals, firing the head of the whistleblowers office, and calling for corruption charges on NY Mayor Adams to be dropped.
          Trump's DOJ also dropped charges on Republican congressman, Jeff Fortenberry, who had been awaiting trial on charges accusing him of lying to the FBI, as well as the 2 Trump aids charges along Trump in his documents case.
          The moves showed Trump's willingness to break from having an apolitical justice system in favor of aligning the DOJ with Trump's political agenda.

          Comey led the FBI when authorities began a criminal investigation in 2016 into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government to influence the election.
          Trump then fired Comey in 2017 after Comey publicly confirmed Trump was under investigation, when the probe was taken over by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who found no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between Trump and Russia.

          On February 19, 2025, the DOJ's senior ethics official (associate deputy attorney general), Bradley Weinsheimer, resigned after 34 years in the DOJ due to Trump reassigning him to a new sanctuary cities work group.
          Weinsheimer was replaced by Kendra Wharton, who defended Trump in the pornstar case, and Jordan Fox, who graduated law school in 2021.

          On April 22, the DOJ reassigned about a dozen senior career attorneys from its civil rights unit/
          The reassignments were part of a larger effort by Trump to transform the DOJ Civil Rights Division from protecting minorities (dropped all police abuse charges) to going after Trump issues like college anti-semitism and transgender people in sports.

          By July, 69 of the 110 lawyers in the Federal Programs Branch (defends government in court) have resigned since Trump took office.
          The lawyers cited a punishing workload and the need to defend policies that some felt were not legally justifiable among the key reasons for the wave of departures.

          On March 21, the FBI cut staffing in their Domestic Terrorism Operations Section and has scrapped a tagging investigations as domestic terrorism for tracking.
          The move came as the US was facing a growing threat from right wing extremists, including the Jan 6 insurrection and the 2017 white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville.

          Schleifer was fired only 1 hour after right-wing twitter personality Laura Loomer called for him to be fired for anti-Trump comments.
          Karoline Leavitt later said that an unprecedented 50+ career US attorneys and deputies had been fired in recent weeks.

        <li><u>Trump's Plumbers</u>
          On April 25, 2025, the DOJ began allowing prosecutors in criminal investigations to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to compel "production of information and testimony by and relating to members of the news media."
          The directive reverses a Biden DOJ policy that barred prosecutors from seizing reporters' phone and email records in most circumstances, following criticism of the DOJ for secretly subpoenaing records on reporters and congressional staff members as prosecutors pursued leaks of national security information during Trump's first term.
          Some of the most consequential reporting in U.S. history — from Watergate to warrantless wiretapping after 9/11 — was and continues to be made possible because reporters have been able to protect the identities of confidential sources.
          The move came when Trump repeatedly said he was pursuing a policy of "radical transparency."

          On August 3, 2025, Texas Democratic lawmakers left the state in order to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts.
          Trump championed the redistricting plan that was expected to yield as many as five additional House Republicans in the 2026 midterms, at the time Republicans held a narrow 220-212 majority in the house with three Democratic held seats vacant from Texas following one member's death.
          States are required to redistrict every 10 years based on the U.S. Census but the Texas map was passed just four years ago by the Republican-dominated legislature. 
          While mid-cycle redistricting occasionally takes place, it is usually prompted by a change in power at the legislature.

          On July 21, the DOJ released 240,000 pages of documents related to the assassination of MLK.
          The files included FBI files, which had surveilled the civil rights leader as part of an effort to discredit the Nobel Peace Prize winner and his civil rights movement.
          In recent years, the FBI has acknowledged that as an example of "abuse and overreach" in its history.

        <li><u>Epstein Files</u>
          In February 2025, far-right twitter influencers were invited to the White House and provided with binders marked "The Epstein Files: Phase 1" and "Declassified" that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain, leading to internet backlash.
          After the release flopped, in a March TV interview, Bondi claimed the Biden administration "sat on these documents, no one did anything with them," adding: "Sadly these people don't believe in transparency, but I think more unfortunately, I think a lot of them don't believe in honesty."
          On July 7, the DOJ said Epstein didn't have a client list and that no more files related to the wealthy financier's sex trafficking investigation would be made public despite promises from Attorney General Pam Bondi that had raised the expectations of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.
          Bondi suggesting in a Fox News interview earlier that year that such a document was "sitting on my desk" for review.
          FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino have also insisted in television and podcast interviews that the evidence was clear that Epstein had killed himself.
          They also released a video from outside Epstein's jail cell as proof he actually killed himself.
          Bondi cited the existence of "tens of thousands" of videos that she said showed Epstein "with children or child porn" as the reason for no more public releases, despite multiple people who participated in the criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell saying they had not seen and did not know of a trove of recordings along the lines of what Bondi had referenced. 
          Indictments and detention memos also don't allege the existence of video recordings and neither Epstein nor Maxwell were charged with possession of child sex abuse material even though that would have been easier for prosecutors to prove than the sex trafficking counts they faced.

          After the July 7 memo, Trump had to deal with the fallout on Twitter from his conspiracy brained followers, who were calling for Bondi to be fired.
          Trump chose to stand with Bondi, saying "I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case is of interest to anybody," and urging his followers to just move on.

          On July 17, Trump asked for a release of grand jury testimony from the Epstein case but also said he would not recommend appointing a special prosecutor on the case.
          U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida on July 23 denied the administration's request to unseal records from the grand jury investigations in 2005 and 2007 finding that the request did not fall into any of the limited exceptions that may allow for the release of such material.
          Manhattan-based U.S. District Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer responded to the DOJ and asked them to flesh out the legal bases for the requests.
          On July 30, the DOJ responded saying unsealing the materials would be appropriate given the "abundant public interest" in the Epstein case and persistent scrutiny of how it was handled by federal law enforcement.

          On July 18, Trump sued the Wall Street Journal and its owners including Rupert Murdoch for $10 billion over the newspaper's report that his name was on a 2003 birthday greeting for Epstein, calling Trump's alleged birthday greeting "fake." 
          The day before, the WSJ reported on a letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people.
          The WSJ said the letter had typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker and that the the letter concluded "Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret," featuring the signature "Donald."
          A $10 billion award would far exceed the largest defamation judgments and settlements in recent history, including a $1.5 billion judgment against Alex Jones, and Fox News' settlement for $787.5 million with Dominion Voting.

          The White House sent mixed signals by initially saying the report was "fake news," but a White House official later told Reuters the administration was not denying that Trump's name appears in some files, noting that Trump was already included in the February documents for conservative influencers.
          The same day, U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg denied the DOJ's request for grand jury documents, saying that it did not fall into any of the exceptions to rules requiring grand jury material be kept secret.
          Also on the same day, the House Oversight Committee approved 8-2 a subpoena seeking all DOJ files on Epstein.

          On July 24 and 25, Deputy Attorney General and former personal lawyer to Trump, Todd Blanche met with Ghislaine Maxwell for interviews on more info about the Epstein case.
          The meeting was highly unusual, as senior officials typically do not personally conduct investigative interviews.
          When asked if he would consider a pardon for Maxwell, Trump said "It's something I haven't thought about."

        <li><u>Obama Treason</u>
          On July 18, 2025, Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents and said the information she was releasing showed a "treasonous conspiracy" in 2016 by top Obama administration officials to undermine Trump and threatened to refer the officials to the DOJ.
          However, Gabbard conflated two separate U.S. intelligence findings in alleging that Obama had changed an assessment that Russia probably was not trying to influence the election through cyber means.
          One finding was that Russia was not trying to hack U.S. election infrastructure to change vote counts and the second was that Moscow probably was using cyber means to influence the U.S. political environment through information and propaganda operations, including by stealing and leaking data from Democratic Party servers.
          In January 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment ordered by Obama built on that second finding: that Putin authorized influence operations to sway the 2016 vote to Trump.
          On July 22, amid the Epstein fallout, Trump accused Obama of "treason" for leading an effort to falsely tie him to Russia and undermine his 2016 presidential campaign.
          Trump said, "It's time to start, after what they did to me, and whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people. Obama has been caught directly."
          Obama denounced Trump's claims, saying "these bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction."
          On July 2, CIA director Ratcliffe found flaws in the production of the January 2017 assessment but did not contest its conclusion and upheld "the quality and credibility" of a highly classified CIA report on which the assessment's authors relied.

          On Mar 19, 2025, the Trump admin suspended $175 million in funding to the University of Pennsylvania over its transgender sports policies.
          UPenn previously made national headlines in 2022 when a transgender student athlete, swimmer Lia Thomas, competed on its women's swim team.

      <h3>Mass Shootings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Israel embassy aides killed</u>
          On May 21, 2025, a lone gunman opened fire with a handgun outside of a Jewish museum in Chicago as people were leaving an event for young professionals and diplomats hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.
          In the shooting, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, both Israeli Embassy staffers and a young couple about to become engaged to be married, were killed. 
          The gunman was Elias Rodriguez, who was charged with two counts of first degree murder for the killings.
          Surveillance video showed Rodriguez firing several times at Lischinsky and Milgrim, then leaning over them to fire several more rounds after they fell to the ground and after Milgrim tried to crawl away and sat up, then he paused to reload and resumed firing.
          Rodriguez told police on the scene, "I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza" and chanted "Free Palestine" after he was taken into custody.
          Rodriguez also posted a manifesto on social media the day before the shooting, titled "Escalate For Gaza, Bring The War Home," it condemned Israel's killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians since the October 2023 Hamas attacks, and discussed the morality of "armed" action.
          Rodriguez was once involved with the far-left Party for Socialism and Liberation that ended in 2017, the PSL said they had nothing to do with the attack and do not support it.
          Rodriguez was also identified in a 2018 local news report as a member of the Chicago branch of a national group called ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), which has organized demonstrations in solidarity with Palestinians.
          Trump and Netanyahu both condemned the shooting as antisemetic.

          On August 6, Rodriguez was indicted by a federal grand jury on 9 counts including federal hate crime charges, first degree murder, and murder of a foreign official, with a special finding that makes him eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
          The indictments allege that Rodriguez had a history of violent rhetoric online against Israelis, including a plea to "vaporize every Israeli 18 and above."

        <li><u>Minnesota lawmakers killed</u>
          On June 14, 2025, Minnesota Police and the FBI issued a manhunt after a man posing as a police officer killed former Minnesota State House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, before fleeing on foot after getting in a fire-fight with law enforcement.
          The suspect was identified as Vance Luther Boelter, who also seriously wounded Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman and his wife after shooting them multiple times before going to the Hortman's. 
          Police found Boether's abandoned vehicle, disguised as a police SUV, where they found a "manifesto" and a target list of about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states. 
          The list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats including Walz, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, Senator Tina Smith and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.
          In response to the events, the organizing No Kings Coalition canceled all protests in Minnesota (shooting was on same day as Trump birthday parade), citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect's at-large status.

          On June 16, police finally found and arrested Boelter.
          According to social media postings, Boelter had links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa.
          Boelter was charged on state charges with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder.

          Later on June 16, Boelter appeared in court where it was revealed he visited 4 other legislators homes on the night og the killings.
          The affidavit said Boelter planned the attack for some time with his notebook containing the names and, in some cases, home addresses for more than 45 elected officials, "mostly or all Democrats."

          On June 17, Trump said he would not call Minnesota Governor Waltz about the shooting.
          Trump said "I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling him. Why would I call him?"
          and "The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?"

        <li><u>Manhattan NFL Shooting</u>
          On July 28, 2025, Shane Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental illness struggles, killed four people in a shooting rampage at a Midtown Manhattan office building.
          Tamura used an M4 Carbine semi-automatic rifle during the shooting before taking his own life.
          Tamura was carrying a note, blaming the NFL for his degenerative brain disease (CTE).
          Tamura was never an NFL player, but online records show he played in high school.
          Tamura appeared to have driven to New York City from Las Vegas over three days and to have acted alone, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
          The NFL has its headquarters in the skyscraper, but Tamura apparently entered the wrong elevator bank and ended up in the offices of Rudin Management, a real estate company, where he shot employees.
          Among those killed was a Blackstone senior executive Wesley LePatner (Blackstone's headquarters is in the same tower) and NYPD officer, Didarul Islam, 36, who came from Bangladesh and had been on the force three years.

      <ul>
        <li><u>Mexico</u>:
          On August 1, Trump granted Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30% on many goods to allow time to negotiate a broader trade pact.

        <li><u>Canada</u>
          On June 27, 2025, Trump abruptly cut off trade talks with Canada, saying that Canada's newly enacted digital services tax on U.S. technology firms was "a direct and blatant attack on our country." 
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tariff-deals-could-be-wrapped-up-by-labor-day-bessent-says-talks-pick-up-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>

        <li><u>China</u>
          On May 12, 2025, the US and China agreed to a temporary truce in their tariff trade war, after days of talks mediated in Switzerland.
          The deal leaves US tariffs on China at 30% and China tariffs on the US at 10% from May 14 to August 12.

          Also in the deal, Beijing agreed to supply magnets and rare earth minerals in exchange for the US allowing Chinese students in its colleges and universities.

        <li><u>Brazil</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump slapped a 50% tariff on most Brazilian goods to fight what he has called a "witch hunt" against former President Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from the heavier levies.

        <li><u>India</u>
          On August 6, 2025, Trump imposed an additional 25% tariffs on goods from India (bringing total tp 50%), saying they directly or indirectly imported Russian oil.

        <li><u>Copper</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump announced 50% tariffs on copper piping, dragging down U.S. copper prices more than 17%.
          The move aids manufacturers, but does little to boost the constrained U.S. copper mining industry, which for years has asked Washington for permitting reform or other steps that could fuel growth.
          The move is essentially a boost for Chile and Peru, two of the world's largest copper miners and major suppliers to the United States.

        <li><u>De minimis exemption</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump fully suspended the de minimis exception for all US good imports.
          In Trump's Big Beautiful Bill he repealed the legal basis for the de minimis exemption worldwide starting on July 1, 2027.
          Goods shipped through the postal system will face one of two tariffs: either an "ad valorem duty" equal to the effective tariff rate of the package's country of origin or, for six months, a specific tariff of $80 to $200 depending on the country of origin's tariff rate.
          Between 2015 and 2024, the annual volume of de minimis shipments entering the U.S. increased from 134 million shipments to over 1.36 billion shipments. U.S. Customs processes over 4 million daily de minimis shipments.

        <li><u>"Liberation Day"</u>
          On April 2, 2025, Trump imposes "reciprocal" tariffs at a base rate of 10% on 50+ countries and with larger tariffs on many of the countries. 
          In response to the tariffs, automaker Stellantis said it would temporarily lay off U.S. workers and close plants in Canada and Mexico, while General Motors said it would increase U.S. production.
          Howard Lutnick and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro both Trump would not back off, and that the tariff increases were not a negotiation.
          However, Trump later said, "The tariffs give us great power to negotiate."
          The Dow dropped 4% (worst since June 2020), the S&P500 dropped 5%, and the Nasdaq fell 6% (worst since March 2020) due to resurging inflation and recession worries.
          For the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.08%, the Nasdaq declined 10.02%, and the Dow fell 7.86%. The Russell 2000 Small Cap Index dropped 9.70%, confirming a bear market.
          Imports to the United States now face an average duty of 22.5%, up from 2.5% in 2024.
          The tariffs also alienated allies in Asia and undercut US strategic efforts to contain China.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          Tariff "calculation": 
          Trump's formula for calculating the tariffs was to take the U.S. goods trade deficit with a country, divide it by that country's exports to the U.S. and turn it into a percentage figure; then cut that figure in half to produce the U.S. "reciprocal" tariff, with a floor of 10%.
          This ended up making the uninhabited volcanic Australian territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic, largely inhabited by penguins, have a 10% tariff.
          This also disproportionately hurt the poorest countries in the world such as Madagascar (47% reciprocal tariff, $500 GDP per capita, $733 million of US exports), Lesotho (50% reciprocal tariff), Cambodia (49% reciprocal tariff).
          These countries are so poor they cannot import any US goods due to them being so expensive (they aren't buying Teslas), so they got punished with the sharpest tariff rates as a result.

          In mid-July, Lesotho declared a national state of disaster due to the "high rates of youth unemployment and job losses" caused by uncertainty surrounding the tariffs.
          Lesotho's liberation day tariffs were originally 50% and Trump's walkback to 10% didn't prevent the economic fallout from the tariffs.
          Lesotho exported $237 million to the US in 2024, mostly textiles for popular brands such as Levi's and Calvin Klein, making up 1/10th of their GDP and 45% of their total exports.
          Previously, in his March 2025 address to Congress, Trump referred to Lesotho as a country "no one has heard of," which Lesotho's FM Lejone Mpotjoane said was "quite insulting."
          Lesotho is one of the world's poorest countries, with 2 million people and a GDP per capita of $916.

        <li><u>The Problem with Tariffs</u>
            <u>Retaliation</u>: the tariffs cause other countries to retaliate, not buy from the US anymore, dump their US bonds to raise rate on US debt (China has $769 bln and Japan has $1.01 tln)
            <u>Supply chains</u>: products today take a lot of parts, these parts come from all over the world meaning tariffs will drive up the price of manufacuring massively and cause stagflation.
            <u>Reduced military spending</u>: if the tariffs cause a recession that will decrease tax revenue, which will decrease defense spending, which will be worse for manufacturing, which is what the tariffs were meant to be for.
            <u>Recession from uncertainty</u>: uncertainty means no investments, which means no sales and no economic growth, with means recession.
            <u>Recession from lower consumer activity</u>: if consumers think the tariffs with go away in 2029 with a new administration they will wait to spend money, which will cause a recession.
            <u>Lower trade deficits</u>: if the US is not importing as much then other countries will have less US dollars, which means they will buy less treasury bonds, which means the US debt rate will increase (1% increase in intrest rates means +80B in annual US debt payments).
            <u>Mistrust of the US</u>: the tariffs included Taiwan and the EU, which are not countries and shows the lack of a plan of caring that went into crafting tariff policy, if people stop trusting the US then the reserve currency status of the US is at stake.

          After Trump imposed his secondary tariff deadline on Moscow Medvedev accused him of playing a "game of ultimatums" and moving a step closer to war between Russia and the U.S.
          Trump retorted: "Tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he's still President, to watch his words. He's entering very dangerous territory!"
          On July 31, Medvedev waded in again saying Trump's "nervous reaction" showed Russia was on the right course and referring again to Moscow's nuclear capabilities.
          This prompted Trump to deliver a statement the following day on posting U.S. nuclear submarines in "the appropriate regions."

          On August 4, 2025, rubio sent a State Department cable which instructed US diplomats in Europe to launch a lobbying campaign to build opposition to the EU's Digital Service Act (DSA), which Washington says restricted free speech.
          The EU's DSA is a landmark law meant to make the online environment safer and fairer by compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.
          The order to US diplomats marks an acceleration of the Trump admin's efforts to promote what it calls "America's free speech tradition".
          Rubio's directive takes particular aim at the DSA's description of illegal content, saying it was expansive, and told U.S. diplomats to advocate to get the definition of "illegal content" narrowed so that it would not curb freedom of expression, including in political and religious discourse.
          Another suggestion was to withdraw or amend the DSA'a Code of Conduct on Disinformation, which the State Department said was setting "overly broad controls" on content in a way that was undermining freedom of expression.
          Other talking points included removing or reducing fines for non-compliance to content restrictions, and not relying on "trusted flaggers", entities designated by national authorities to report illegal online content to platforms.

                    <li>The NCAA had long prohibited student-athletes from receiving compensation for athletics outside of scholarships in a bid to preserve the amateurism of college sports and keep the playing field fair for recruiting.
                      However, in June 2021, the organization approved an interim policy allowing college athletes to make money by selling their name, image and likeness (NIL) rights.
                      The policy allowed student athletes to make money through activities such as signing autographs, endorsing products or businesses, and making personal appearances.
                      In March 2025, the NCAA agreed to permanently eliminate its rule that prohibited student athletes from negotiating NIL deals before enrolling in a school.
                      The change came a day after a legal settlement between the NCAA and a group of state attorneys general who had sued the organization, arguing that the restriction violated federal antitrust law.
                      Experts say the problem is that the NCAA and athletic conferences that govern top sports "have stubbornly refused to grant employment status and collective bargaining to athletes."

                    In the test, children have to run and perform situps, pullups or pushups and a sit-and-reach test, but in 2012 it evolved into the Youth Fitness Program, which the Obama admin said "moved away from recognizing athletic performance to providing a barometer on student's health."
                    Then-first lady Michelle Obama also promoted her "Let's Move" initiative focused on reducing childhood obesity through diet and exercise.

                      "Reputational risk" is when banks could sanction institutions for activities that are not strictly prohibited but could expose the bank to negative publicity or costly litigation.
                      Banks increasingly complained the reputational risk standard was too subjective and vague, allowing bank supervisors to effectively bar firms from providing services to some people or sectors.

                      Trump claimed without evidence in a CNBC interview that he personally was discriminated against by JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America refused to take his deposits following his first term in office.
                      JPMorgan said it does not close accounts for political reasons and Bank of America said it does not comment on client matters but would welcome clearer regulations.

                    Asset managers welcomed the news, saying it was a major step toward modernizing retirement savings.
                    BlackRock, which lobbied the Trump administration to expand asset options, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets in 2026.
                    The new investment options carry lower disclosure requirements and are generally less easy to sell quickly for cash than the publicly traded stocks and bonds that most retirement funds rely on and they also tend to carry higher fees.
                    Many private equity firms are hungry for the new source of cash that retail investors could offer after three years in which high interest rates shook their time-honored model of buying companies and selling them at a profit.
                    However, private equity firms said the industry may seek litigation reform before it can expand into the market.
                    The Department of Labor issued similar guidance during Trump's first term but few took advantage, fearing litigation.
