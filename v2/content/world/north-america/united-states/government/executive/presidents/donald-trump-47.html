        <li><u>Trump Mara-lago Assassination Attempt</u>
          On September 8, 2025, Ryan Routh began his trial for attempting to kill Trump and, facing the prospect of life in prison, opted to fire his legal team and defend himself in court (he has no formal legal training).
          U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who is overseeing the case, rejected Routh's proposed questions to prospective jurors in the case, calling them "very much off base" and irrelevant to the proceedings. 
          The questions included queries about pro-Palestinian student activism and Trump's support for a U.S. takeover of Greenland.
          Since firing his team of public defenders in July, Routh has used court filings to propose a "beatdown session" with Trump, floated trading himself for a prisoner held by China or Iran and unsuccessfully sought to introduce expert testimony of his own "narcissism."
          During opening arguments in September 11, Cannon stopped Routh's presentation to the jury after only a few minutes after Routh delved into topics including the origin of the human species, the settlement of the American West and international conflicts.

          </sup>
          On September 23, after just a three day trial, the jury convicted Routh of attempting to assassinate Trump and the four other counts he had faced.
          Routh appeared to try to stab himself with a pen several times after the verdict was revealed in court and had to be restrained by U.S. marshals.
          His daughter Sara also yelled in court that her father had not hurt anyone and she would get him out of prison.
          Routh fled from the golf course without firing a shot after a U.S. Secret Service agent patrolling the course ahead of Trump spotted Routh and the rifle and opened fire, according to witness testimony in the case.

      <h2>Major Issues</h2>
      <h3>Immigration</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Birthright Citizenship</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed an executive order to end birthright citizenship in the US.
          A day after the EO, 22 Dem-led states, the District of Columbia, and the city if San Fransisco sued Trump in Boston and Seattle and the American Civil Liberties Union immigrant organization also filed seperate lawsuits, both of which said Trump's order violated the 14th amendment.  
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/lawsuits-challenge-trumps-birthright-citizenship-other-orders-2025-01-21/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          Opponents of birthright citizenship say that if the drafters of the 14th amendment wanted all people born in the US to be citizens they would not have said that citizens "be subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
          They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and, by implication, their children.
          However, most scholars dismiss the interpretation, since people in the country illegally are still subject to the laws of the US and are thus "subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/what-is-us-birthright-citizenship-can-trump-end-it-2025-01-21/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On January 23, a Seattle US District judge, John Coughenour, blocked the order from being enforces for 14 days while the judge considers a long-term ruling. 
          Coughenour said the order was "blatantly unconstitutional," referring to the 14th amendment that says any person born in the US is a citizen under the Citizenship Clause.  
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-hear-states-bid-block-trump-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-01-23/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
          On Febrary 6, Coughenour extended his order, setting a nationwide injunction, saying Trump was ignoring the rule of law.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-accuses-trump-ignoring-rule-law-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-02-06/" target="_blank">[4]</a></sup>
          Trump later appealed the order but was denied on Feb 19, 2025.

          On Febrary 5, a second federal judge, U.S. District Judge Deborah Boardman in Maryland, issued a nationwide order blocking Trump from implementing the birthright citizenship EO until the court had ruled on a lawsuit brought to the judge by the CASA and the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project immigrant rights groups and 5 pregnant women.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/second-us-judge-blocks-trumps-birthright-citizenship-order-2025-02-05/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
          Trump appealed the Maryland court order but was denied on February 28.

          On Febrary 10, a third U.S. District Judge, Joseph Laplante, in Concord blocked Trump's birthright EO, saying he expects the issue to be brought to the Supreme Court.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-order-curtailing-us-birthright-citizenship-blocked-by-third-judge-2025-02-10/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
          On March 13, Trump asked the Supreme Court to narrow the 3 orders against him and that the injunctions should be scaled back from applying universally and should be limited to just the plaintiffs that brought the cases and are "actually within the courts' power."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-asks-us-supreme-court-intervene-bid-curb-birthright-citizenship-2025-03-13/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
          On June 27, the SC ruled 6-3 ordering the 3 lower courts to narrow their nationwide rulings but specified that Trump's EO cannot take effect until 30 days from then.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-supreme-court-may-rule-allowing-enforcement-trump-birthright-citizenship-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>
          On July 10, Judge Joseph Laplante issued another nationwide injunction blocking Trump's order, despite the Supreme Court's ruling, after the ACLU refiled the case as a class action.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-weigh-blocking-trump-birthright-citizenship-despite-supreme-court-ruling-2025-07-10/" target="_blank">[11]</a></sup>
          On July 23, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 to uphold Judge Coughenour's decision, agreeing that Trump was violating the 14th Amendment.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-appeals-court-blocks-trumps-order-curtailing-birthright-citizenship-2025-07-24/" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup>
          On July 25, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin in Boston said his earlier nationwide injuction would remain in place despite the Supreme Court ruling.
          Sorokin wrote that the evidence before him "does not support a finding that any narrower option would feasibly and adequately protect the plaintiffs from the injuries they have shown they are likely to suffer if the unlawful policy announced in the Executive Order takes effect during the pendency of this lawsuit."

        </li>
        <li><u>Asylum Ban</u>
          On January 20, 2025, Trump signed a proclamation, blocking all migrants "engaged in the invasion across the southern border" from claiming asylum. 
          On July 2, U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss blocked the proclamation, saying neither federal immigration law nor the U.S. Constitution gave Trump the authority to disregard existing laws and regulations governing the asylum process even if stopping illegal immigration presented "enormous challenges."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-asylum-ban-us-mexico-border-says-he-exceeded-authority-2025-07-02/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On August 1, the US Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit partially granted Moss's order, saying Trump's order cannot be used to entirely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers.
          On August 4, the Trump Admin instructed CBP to stop deportations under the asylum ban and process migrants under US migration law.

        </li>
        <li><u>TPS</u> 
          In 2021, Biden granted TPS to Venezuelans, citing high levels of crime in Venezuela due to instbaility from Maduro.
          On Mar 31, 2025, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco paused a DHS decision to remove temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezualans.
          600,000 Venezualans in the US have TPS, the ruling protects 348,000 of them.
          In the ruling, Chen said "Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes."
          Venezuelan TPS holders are more likely to hold bachelor's degrees than U.S. citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general U.S. population.
          On April 18, the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to pause Chen's TRO while they considered the case, due to the Trump admin not showing it would suffer irreparable harm from the TRO.
          On May 19, the Supreme Court paused Chen's TRO while the appeals court considers the case (Jackson was the only one to publicly dissent), allowing Trump to move ahead with ending TPS for Venezuelans.
          On August 29, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to uphold Chen's decision and that Trump's likely acted unlawfully when revoking TPS for the Venezualans.
          However, Chen's ruling remains on hold while the litigation plays out as a result of the Supreme Court's order.
          On September 3, the Trump admin said they will still be ending TPS for Venezuelans, with it set to expire on September 10.
          On September 5, Judge Chen ruled that Noem lacked the authority to end TPS for the Venezuelans and the decision to do so was motivated by racism.
          Chen said that Noem's justification for cancelling TPS (that the countries were safe to return to) was unjustified since she made that decision without first consulting with relevant federal agencies or conducting a comprehensive review of conditions in the two countries.
          On September 18, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected to block Chen's order.

          On June 24, Noem said the 521,000 Haitians granted TPS under Biden will have their status terminated on September 2 (original date she set in February was for Aug 2).
          On September 5, Judge Chen ruled that Noem lacked the authority to end TPS for the Venezuelans and the decision to do so was motivated by racism.
          Chen said that Noem's justification for cancelling TPS (that the countries were safe to return to) was unjustified since she made that decision without first consulting with relevant federal agencies or conducting a comprehensive review of conditions in the two countries.

          </sup>
          On July 1, U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn blocked Noem's Hatian TPS revokation, saying "Secretary Noem does not have statutory or inherent authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation," making her actions "unlawful."
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-ending-temporary-protected-status-haitians-2025-07-01/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
          On July 7, Trump said he would be ending TPS for 72,000 Hondurans and 4,000 Nicaraguans on September 6, despite many of the migrants having been living and working in the US for decades.
          The migrants from both countries had come to the US under TPS after the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, but Trump said TPS was overused and that many immigrants no longer merit protections.

          On July 14, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit granted an administrative stay on Trump's termination of TPS for Afghans and Cameroons until July 21.
          The DHS originally set TPS termination for Afghans on July 14, while that of Cameroonians was set to end on August 4.

          On August 20, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled to end TPS for immigrants from Nicaragua, Honduras and Nepal while court challenges play out, reversing an earlier order from U.S. District Judge Trina L. Thompson.
          The order immediately ends protections for Nepalis, which expired on August 5, while TPS for Hondurans and Nicaraguans will expire on September 8.

        <li><u>Humanitarian Parole</u>
          On March 21, 2025, Trump revoked the temporary parole status of 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who were in the US.
          Biden had previously granted to the migrants parole, allowing them to enter the country by air if they had U.S. sponsors.
          Trump made the decision in order the fast track the deportation of the migrants.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-revokes-legal-status-530000-cubans-haitians-nicaraguans-venezuelans-2025-03-21/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On April 10, US District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston blocked Trump from revoking TPS for 450,000 of the migrants but said she would not force the admin to grant further TPS.
          On May 5, Trump's appeal of Talawani's order was rejected.
          On May 28, Judge Talwani ordered Trump to resume processing applications from migrants seeking work permits or more lasting immigration status who are living in the country temporarily under "parole" programs.
          The ruling affected migrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, and Ukraine who were granted a two-year "parole" to live in the country by Biden.
          On May 30, the Supreme Court halted Talwani's order (only Jackson and Sotomayor publicly dissented).
          On September 12, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned overturned Talwani's ruling, saying Noem's action forced parolees to choose suddenly between returning to the dangers in their home countries or staying in the US and risk being deported but that the plaintiffs failed to show that Noem lacked authority under INA to categorically end their parole.

        <li><u>H-1B Visas</u>
          In late December 2024, Trump sided with Elon Musk amid a large public dispute over the use of H-1B visas, saying he fully backs the program for foreign tech workers.
          Musk previously vowed to go to "war" to defend the visa program for foreign tech workers.
          Trump previously moved to limit the visas' use during his first presidency but seemed to shift on them now.
          Musk is himself a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has held an H-1B visa, and his company Tesla obtained 724 of the visas in 2024.
          The altercation was set off earlier in the week by far-right activist Laura Loomer who criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration's immigration policies.
          Loomer issued an apology later in the week after "accidentally" doxxing Krishnan.

          </sup>
          On September 19, 2025, issued a proclamation announcing it would start requiring companies to pay $100,000 per year for H-1B worker visas.
          Microsoft, JPMorgan, and Amazon responded to the announcement by advising employees holding H-1B visas to remain in or to return to the US before midnight on Saturday when the new fee structures are set to take effect. 
          The number of foreign STEM workers in the U.S. more than doubled between 2000 and 2019 to nearly 2.5 million, even as overall STEM employment only increased 44.5% during that time.
          The move could add millions of dollars in costs for companies, which could hit smaller tech firms and start-ups particularly hard.
          Analysts suggested the fee could force companies to move high-value work overseas, hampering America's position in the AI race with China.
          In 2024, India was the largest beneficiary of H-1B visas, accounting for 71% of approved beneficiaries, while China was a distant second at 11.7%.
          In the first half of 2025, Amazon.com had approval for over 12,000 H-1B visas, while Microsoft and Meta Platforms had over 5,000 H-1B visa approvals each.
          Despite tech holding a majority of H-1B visas, their CEOs were overwhelmingly quiet about the announcement, likely due to fear of retaliation from Trump.
          The H-1B program offers 65,000 visas annually to employers bringing in temporary foreign workers in specialized fields, with another 20,000 visas for workers with advanced degrees.
          Usually, nearly all the visa fees are paid by employers, with the H-1B visas being approved for a period of three to six years.
          Panic, confusion and anger reigned as workers on H-1B visas from India and China were forced to abandon travel plans and rush back to the U.S.
          Many criticized the move and the chaotic roll-out with the White House eventually clarifying the hefty fees would be charged just once, not annually, and they would not apply to existing holders including those who happened to be overseas at the time of the announcement.

          Trump's plan also drew concern from the healthcare industry, with foreign-trained physicians filling 20% of US family medicine posts, disproportionately serving rural and underserved areas.
          In 2025, of the 442,000 H-1B visas approved, 5,640 were in healthcare.
          It is also important to note that the US is projected to be short 13,500 to 86,000 physicians by 2036.

          Due to there only being 85,000 annual visas, the annual allotment is taken up as soon as applications open on April 1st. 
          This lottery system is a bad approach due to higher skilled workers having the same opportunity to get a visa as low skilled workers.
          The H1-B lasts for three years and can be extended to six, after which workers must either leave the country or transition to a green card.
          The INA caps the number of green cards to available to applicants from any single country at 7% of the total green cards issued each year, meaning countries with high populations like India and China have really long green card wait times, making their only real route to working in the US being the H1-B visa.

          </sup>
          According to Pew Research, 57% of H1-B workers had a master's degree and 34% had a bachelor's degree.
          This means most H-1B workers study at a university and most of them do so in the US, paying higher fees than US-born students in the process, so they can stay after and get a job in the US.
          With Trump's new fee, this would make so H-1B talent will leave US universities, due to them not being able to get a job in the US after graduating.
          It also incentivises US firms to hire workers from abroad rather than investing in training domestic talent, which was seen during Trump's first term when H-1B's were under scrutiny.
          <sup><a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/04/what-we-know-about-the-us-h-1b-visa-program/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
          A census report found that 72% of US STEM graduates work in non-STEM occupations.
          Among the 13.7 million STEM majors working in non-STEM jobs, 36 percent earn more than STEM majors do in STEM jobs. 
          The median STEM major in a STEM job made $110,000 in 2023. 
          Over 4.9 million STEM majors earned at least that much in non-STEM jobs that year. 
          That total is comparable to the 5.1 million STEM majors who work in STEM jobs in total.
          This means that STEM majors might be choosing to work in non-STEM jobs, or that companies are choosing lower paid H-1B workers over higher paid US STEM workers.
          <sup><a href="https://eig.org/stem-graduates/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
          Trump administration officials say the visa allows companies to suppress wages, and curbing it opens more jobs for U.S. tech workers. 
          Supporters of the program argue that it brings in highly skilled workers essential to filling talent gaps and keeping firms competitive.
          In a 2017 NBER study, they found using data from the 1994-2001 tech boom, that there was a substantial rise in foreign high skill workforce from H-1B visas.
          They found that foreign labor had positive effects on labor and firms earned substantially higher outcome due to the workers.
          They also found that despite immigration increasing the overall welfare of US natives it also caused wages for US computer scientists to be 2.6% to 5.1% lower and caused employment in computer science for US workers to be 6.1% to 10.8% lower in 2001. 
          On the other hand, immigration also lowered prices and raised the output of IT goods by between 1.9% and 2.5%, benefiting consumers.
          In a 2016 Berkeley paper, they said "Our primary finding on employment is that additional H-1Bs at most increase total firm employment by a moderate amount. The preponderance of evidence indicates that H-1B workers at least partially crowd out other workers… We find an insignificant effect of additional H-1B visas on patenting and the R&E credit… Overall, our results are more supportive of the narrative in which marginal H-1Bs crowd out other workers, are paid less than alternative workers, and increase the firm's profits—despite little effect on measures of the quantity of firm innovation.""
          One reason that H1-B workers are paid less is because they are typically younger workers.

        <li><u>Alien Enemies Act</u>: 
          On March 15, 2025, Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, saying the United States was facing an "invasion." 
          Under Trump's proclamation, all Venezuelan citizens 14+ years of age and determined to be members of the gang and are in the US illegally, are subject to the Alien Enemies act.
          The Alien Enemies Act is best known for its use to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during WW2.

          Hours later, a US District Judge, James Boasberg, issued a TRO blocking the deportations for 14 days (later extended to April 12), saying the act "does not provide a basis for the president's proclamation given that the terms invasion, predatory incursion really relate to hostile acts perpetrated by any nation and commensurate to war."
          The ACLU had previously sued Trump for the 5 Venezualan deportations, saying they had been misidentified as being part of Tren de Aragua.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-extends-block-trump-use-wartime-law-deportations-2025-03-28/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On April 18, a classified assessment from the National Intelligence Council that drew from 18 intelligence agencies repeatedly stated that TdA is not coordinated with or supported by Maduro or senior Venezualean officials.
          However, the report did find that TdA had minimal contact with low-level members of the Venezualean government.
          Of the 18 agencies involved, only the FBI disagreed, saying they thought Maduro was "likely" weaponizing TdA against the US.
          After the report was made public, Gabbard's acting chief of staff Joe Kent ordered a "new assessment written on TDA and their relationship with the government of Venezuela that reflects basic common sense."
          Once Michael Collins, the NIC chief, refused to redo the assessement, he and his vice chair, Maria Langan-Riekhof were fired.

          Trump did this to use troops to detain migrants without invoking the 1807 Insurrection Act that empowers a president to deploy the U.S. military to suppress events such as civil disorder.

          On September 29, 2025, a Reuters review found that 10% fewer people were prosecuted for drug violations compared to the same period of 2024, a drop of about 1,200 cases and the slowest rate since at least the late 1990s.
          The pullback was more dramatic for the types of conspiracy and money-laundering (dropped 24%) cases often used to pursue higher-level traffickers. 
          They also interviewed officials who said investigations and prosecutions for drug cases have been slower due to a shift in focus on violations of immigration law. 
          Despite the amount of drugs having been seized by US CBP so far in 2025 being up 6%, there was also a drop of 6% of people being charged with importing drugs into the US and the number of people charged in drug conspiracies fell about 15%.
          With a new focus on immigration, for the first time in decades, nearly half the people charged with federal crimes in 2025 were for immigration violations and 700 more federal prosecutors were assigned to work on at least some immigration matters, more than 10% of prosecutors.

          On September 23, the eleven people who were deported to Ghana were deported again, with six going to Togo and the others unknown.

        <li><u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u> 
          In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
          In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
          The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).

          On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").

          On April 7, ahead of the deadline, Chief Justice Roberts issued a stay on Xinis' order while they considered the case, after an appeals court refused to pause the TRO for Trump.

          On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
          In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful.

          In the coming days, the Trump admin said Abrego was "alive and secure" but that SC's order to "facilitate" the return of him meant they should only "remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here."

          During the meeting, Pam Bondi said that "facilitate" meant they would just provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia to the US, she also claimed Kilmar had been given a deportation order twice, when he had never been given one.

          In the order Xinis said "To date, what the record shows is that nothing has been done (to get Abrego Garcia back). Nothing." 
          She stopped short of ordering Trump to ask El Salvador outright to return Abrego Garcia but said their refusal to do so was "stunning."

          After Crenshaw's order, Holmes said she would delay her order for release by at least 30 days.
          On the same day, Judge Xinis ruled that if Abrego is released from criminal custody, ICE could not detain him in Tennessee and that his immigration case must be returned to Maryland, and that he must be notified at least three days before any deportation to a third country.

          DHS said ICE had conducted an investigation into the site for seven months and the workers were barred from working in the U.S. after crossing the border illegally or overstaying visas.
          Many of the people arrested were skilled workers who were sent to the U.S. to install equipment at the near-complete factory on a visa waver programme, or B-1 business traveller visas, which largely did not allow work.
          For years, South Korean companies said they struggled to obtain short-term work visas for specialists needed in their high-tech plants and had come to rely on a grey zone of looser interpretation of visa rules under previous American administrations.
          On September 8, South Korea and the US agreed to fly the workers home on a chartered plane.
          Seoul expressed unhappiness about the arrests and the public release of footage showing the operation, which involved armoured vehicles and the shackling of workers, all during ongoing trade negotiations between the allied nations.
          On September 10, lawyers for 13 of the arrested workers said they were working legally via the ESTA program, for countries with visa-free travel to the U.S., or with B-1 visas for temporary business travel.

          Illegal aliens generally do not qualify for federal benefits except for emergency medical care.
          Under a 1982 Supreme Court ruling, all children regardless of immigration status are entitled to a free K-12 education.
          On February 19, 2025, Trump's signed executive order "Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders" aimed to target a Biden policy of using the parole authority to temporarily allow illegal immigrants into the US including 900,000 from the Mexico border, 500,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who flew, and 300,000 from Ukraine and Afghanistan.
          Those granted parole for at least a year are "qualified non-citizens," making them eligible for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (child coverage if you make too much for Medicaid), but only after 5 years

          The law did not define what programs count as "federal public benefits," leaving the interpretation up to federal agencies.
          The newly added banned programs included the Head Start preschool programs for low-income children, various grants or programs for substance use recovery and prevention, the Title X Family Planning Program, health workforce programs, and projects for helping people transition from homelessness.

          On April 24, US District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction at the request of request of 16 sanctuary cities and counties nationally.
          In the ruling Orrick said that Trump's saunctuary city order ("Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders") likely unconstitutionally imposed conditions on federal funding without congressional authorization and ran afoul of the localities' due process rights.
          The cities all have laws and policies that limit or prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal officers with civil immigration arrests.
          Orrick previously ruled against a similar EO from Trump's first term, the ruling was upheld in an appeals court.
          On May 8, Judge Orrick ordered Trump not to use a new April sanctuary cities EO he signed ("Protecting American Communities From Criminal Aliens") to bypass his earlier PI that Orrick previously issued in relation to sanctuary cities.
          Orrick said that if this order was used to target funds unrelated to sanctuary policies, their suspension would violate the U.S. Constitution.

          In her order, Williams said for several years, "every Florida governor, every Florida senator, and countless local and national political figures, including presidents, have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection of the Everglades," and that "this order does nothing more than uphold the basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises."

          On April 19, an appeals court put on hold Boasberg's threat of contempt charges.
          On June 24, Erez Reuveni, the former DOJ official who was fired after admitting in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, submitted a whistleblower complaint that Bove pressured DOJ attorneys do defy court orders that blocked migrant removals.
          This included Bove telling colleagues in a March 14 meeting they could consider defying future court orders by telling the courts "fuck you" so that Venezuelan and El Salvador bound planes could take off, Bove denied making such statements in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
          On July 10, US Senate Democrats released internal DOJ text messages and emails coroborating the allegations that Bove directed the defiance of court orders.
          In a March 15 text exchange between Reuveni and his supervisor August Flentje (also was at the March 14 Bove meeting) one of them wrote: "Guess it's time to find out on the 'fuck you.'" "Yup. It was good working with you," the other responded.
          The two then discussed how shocked they were that the DOJ had lied to Boasberg about knowing whether flights were due to depart in the next 24 hours.
          "He knows there are plans for (Alien Enemies Act) removals within the next 24 hours," one of them wrote. "Yes he does," the other replied.
          On August 8, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals sided with the government by a 2-1 vote to overturn Boasberg's contempt ruling, saying "The District Court's order raises troubling questions about judicial control over core executive functions like the conduct of foreign policy and the prosecution of criminal offenses."

        <li><u>New Census</u>
          On August 7, 2025 Trump ordered the Commerce Department to begin work on a new census that excludes immigrants in the US illegally (next census wasn't for 2030).
          Trump's order revisited a push from his first term in which he added a contentious citizenship question the 2020 census but was later blocked by the Supreme Court which said the federal government gave a "contrived" rationale.
          After taking office, President Biden issued an executive order affirming the long standing practice of including all people residing in a state in the official count but Trump revoke that order on his first day during his second term.
          Republicans argue that excluding immigrants in the US illegally would benefit Republican districts and hurt urban areas, which are often Democrat controlled, with the counter argument being that if you don't count everyone you end up misspending money on infrastructure, hospitals, schools, power grids, and water.

        <li><u>Truck Drivers</u>
          On April 28, 2025, Trump signed an order directing enforcement of a rule requiring commercial drivers in the U.S. to meet English-proficiency standards.
          While the English-proficiency standard for truckers was already longstanding U.S. law, but Trump's order reversed 2016 guidance that inspectors not place commercial drivers out of service if their only violation was lack of English.
          On August 21, Rubio paused the issuance of all worker visas for commercial truck drivers.
          The move came after a crash on a Florida highway killed three people involving a driver who was an Indian national and did not speak English or have legal authorization to be in the United States.
          FMCSA said in 2023 that about 16% of U.S. truck drivers were born outside the United States.
          On September 26, the U.S. Transportation Department issued a new rule making non-citizens ineligible for a truck-driving license unless they meet stricter rules, including an employment-based visa, and undergo a mandatory federal immigration status check.

        <li><u>Unaccompanied Children</u>
          On August 31, US District Judge Sparkle Sooknanan issued a TRO that halted the Trump administration from deporting 10 migrant Guatemalan children already boarded onto planes for 14 days after their lawyers made a pre-dawn emergency appeal.
          The Trump admin had previously struck an agreement with Guatemala that would allow unaccompanied children to be sent back to the country and planned to start deportations the same weekend of the order.
          Migrant children who arrive at U.S. borders without a parent or guardian are classified as unaccompanied and sent to federal government-run shelters until they can be placed with a family member or foster home.
          DOJ attorney Drew Ensign said no children had been removed but that some had been loaded onto planes and that he believed one plane may have taken off but later returned under the judge's order.
          Earlier in the week, Melissa Johnston, director of the HHS' unaccompanied children program, sent an email to staff prohibiting the U.S. release of Guatemalan children in federal custody except for those sponsored by parents or legal guardians in the country.
          The complaint said that in Guatemala, the children "may face abuse, neglect, persecution, or even torture, against their best interests."
          Among the plaintiffs was a 10-year-old indigenous Guatemalan girl whose mother had died and who had suffered abuse and neglect from other caretakers, she was detained at a U.S. government shelter in South Texas.
          Several of the 10 plaintiffs had expressed fear of returning to Guatemala, the complaint said.
          On September 3, an internal Guatemalan government report revealed that Guatemalan authorities had contacted the families of 115 minors who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or guardian and of those, 59 families expressed anger about the possibility of their children being returned to Guatemala, with some even describing it as intimidation.
          The report contradicted claims by the Trump admin, including Stephen Miller saying that the children were being reunited with their parents.
          After the report was submitted to the court, the DOJ withdrew their statement that the parents had requested the deportations.
          On September 13, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly, based in Washington, D.C., who the case was move to, extended the TRO blocking the deportations. 
          On September 18, Kelly kept in place the earlier judicial block on the policy, sharply criticizing the administration's unproven assertion that the children's parents wanted them deported.

        <li><u>ICE Tactics</u>
          In mid September, 2025, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation preventing ICE officers from wearing masks to hide their identities.
          Critics of mask-wearing says it stifles accountability, while Trump officials say officers need to wear them to avoid being targeted.
          By later September, there were multiple high-profile incidents of ICE officers using force during arrests, following the gutting of their oversight offices including the office charged with investigating civil rights violations by personnel.
          These included ICE throwing a Guatemalan woman to the ground in Boston despite her being a permanent resident and an ICE officer <a href="https://x.com/propublica/status/1971387520400425057" target="_blank">charging</a> a woman in NY who was begging officers not to take away her husband, resulting in the officer being placed on leave (then later reinstated).
          There was also an incident where ICE officers shoved and injured journalists, causing one of them to be taken to the hospital.
          ICE also used tear gas, less-lethal rounds, flash bang grenades and pepper balls to quell protests outside an immigration detention center in Chicago, during one of the near-daily protests at the facility.

          On June 9, 2025, Trump sent 2000 National Guard troops to help quell protests that had been going on for 3 days in LA in response to various ICE raids.
          Gavin Newsom called Trump's deployment unlawful and requested their withdrawl.
          Trump used Section 12406 of Title 10 that allows the deployment of the National Guard into federal service if the U.S. is invaded, there is a "rebellion or danger of rebellion" or the president is "unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."
          During the protests, multiple Waymo cars were set on fire and protestors threw concrete and bottles at LAPD officers.
          Eventually the LAPD declared all of downtown LA to be an unlawful assembly.

          LA Mayor Karen Bass said 100 people were arrested after cars were set on fire and several businesses were looted including an Apple store and a CVS pharmacy, she but that most of the protestors were non-violent.
          During the night of June 10, Bass imposed a curfew for 8pm on downtown LA after more lootings took place.

          On July 7, troops were deployed to MacArthur Park in LA after the DHS suspected it was an open-air market for fake identification.
          It was later revealed that Army Major General Scott Sherman had rejected the DHS original request for troops because he believed there was little need for military protection but he was eventually overruled by Hegseth.
          According to a July 1 Army planning document, the operation was "extremely high" risk with the addition of troops and created the potential for violent protests with the possibility for "miscommunication and fratricide" as well as accidental harm to civilians, including children.

          Sherman said a DHS official criticized him and questioned his loyalty to the country after he denied an initial request for military assistance for the operation but a different request for assistance was later approved by Hegseth, Sherman said.

          Breyer put the ruling on hold until September 12 for Trump to appeal.
          The injunction applies only to the military in California, not nationally.
          Breyer wrote in his ruling that "There is no question that federal personnel should be able to perform their jobs without fearing for their safety."
          "But to use this as a hook to send military troops alongside federal agents wherever they go proves too much and would frustrate the very purpose of the Posse Comitatus Act."

        <li><u>Washington DC</u>
          In Federalist No. 43, published January 23, 1788, James Madison argued that the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety.
          The Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783 emphasized the need for the national government to not rely on any state for its own security.
          In 1789, Article One, Section Eight of the Constitution permited the establishment of a "District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States"
          The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. 
          Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the district and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government.
          As such, Washington, D.C., is not part of any state, and is not one itself. 
          Today, D.C. has a population size of 700,000, so the founders would most likely favor a compromise that preserves federal control over the core federal district as a neutral ground for federal officials but grant fuller local autonomy to the residential parts of D.C., so residents aren't disenfranchised.

          On August 11, 2025, Trump invoked the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control.
          The Democratic mayor of Washington, Muriel Bowser, has authority over the city's Metropolitan Police Department but the Home Rule Act allows the president to take control of the MPD for up to 30 days during emergencies if "special conditions of an emergency nature exist."
          Trump also deployed National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., to "re-establish law, order, and public safety," the president is the commander in chief of the D.C. National Guard.
          The president has broad authority over the 2,700 members of the D.C. National Guard, unlike in states where governors typically hold the power to activate troops.
          Guard troops have been dispatched to Washington many times, including in response to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
          He also said "Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals" and said D.C. crime was worse that Bogota and Mexico City, despite violent crime in DC being at a 30-year low in 2024.
          Violent crime fell 26% in the first seven months of 2025 after dropping 35% in 2024, and overall crime dropped 7%, according to the city's police department.
          However, gun violence remains an issue with Washington having the third-highest gun homicide rate among U.S. cities with populations over 500,000 in 2023, according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.
          The homicide rate in the nation's capital was the fourth highest among 24 U.S. cities in 2024, according to a report by the Center for Public Safety Initiatives at Rochester Institute of Technology.
          A CCJ report on crime in Washington showed carjacking rose during 2020 and spiked to a peak of 140 reported incidents, a rate of 20.6 per 100,000 residents, in June 2023 but in June 2025, there were 36 reported incidents, or a rate of 5.1.
          A Reuters/Ipsos poll from August 27 found that just 38% of Americans support using troops for law enforcement in the U.S. capital, with 46% opposed.

          On August 16, the governors from three Republican states sent their National Guard troops to D.C. at Trump's request, including 300-400 from West Virginia, 200 from South Carolina, and 150 from Ohio.
          On August 18, the Republican governors of Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee also agreed to deploy troops to Washington at Trump's request, bringing the total number of National Guard troops in the city to over 1,100.
          However, one Republican governor, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott "politely declined" the federal request.
          The White House said that Guard troops may carry arms but were not making arrests and instead were protecting federal property and providing "a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests."
          On August 24, National Guard troops in D.C. began carrying firearms.
          Most of the guard troops mingled with tourists, posed for selfies, and treated themselves to ice cream from food trucks along Washington's National Mall (Ward 2), one of the safest parts of America's capital.
          "It's boring. We're not really doing much," said Sergeant Fox, who declined to give his first name.
          The troop concentration was near the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial (both Ward 2) and in view of the U.S. Capitol (Ward 6), highlighting that Trump's deployment was just a show of force.
          By contrast with central Washington, residents of Ward 7 and Ward 8 - the area with the highest crime rate - said there was not a guardsman in sight.
          A White House official said that between Aug. 9 and Aug. 17, there had been a total of 212 non-immigration related arrests and of those, 101 were in Wards 7 and 8.

          On August 18, the White House began dispatching social media teams alongside FBI agents executing arrest warrants in D.C. to generate political videos that promote Trump's crackdown on crime.
          The arrangement runs afoul of longstanding DOJ norms which seek to insulate criminal investigations from political influence and could hamstring prosecutors' ability to try their cases by generating pre-trial publicity and raise constitutional questions about suspects' rights to privacy in cases involving arrests carried out in non-public areas.
          The White House posted a highly produced promotional video on X documenting the arrest of Sean Charles Dunn, a now-former DOJ employee who was facing an assault charge after he hurled a Subway sandwich at a federal agent.
          On August 27, a federal grand jury declined to indict Sean Dunn for throwing the sandwich (guess Trump's prosecutors can't indict a ham sandwich).
          On August 28, the DOJ dropped the felony charges on Dunn and instead charged him just with a misdemeanor assault against a federal law enforcement officer, which does not require grand jury approval.

          In May, the MPD placed D.C. police commander Michael Pulliam on paid administrative leave just a week after Pulliam filed an equal employment opportunity complaint against Executive Assistant Chief of Police Andre Wright which was followed by the the police union accusing the department of deliberately falsifying crime data.
          On August 19, the DOJ opened an investigation into whether D.C. manipulated its statistics to make crime rates appear lower.
          On August 27, the House Oversight Committee opened an investigation into the MPD after it heard from a whistleblower with knowledge of internal MPD operations who shared allegations that "crime statistics were manipulated on a widespread basis and at the direction of supervisory officials." 
          There have been long-standing complaints within the department that managers have reclassified crimes to downplay the level of danger in their police districts and avoid scrutiny from higher-ups.
          In a 2020, a D.C. police veteran Sgt. Charlotte Djossou claimed in a lawsuit that the MPD retaliated against her after she raised concerns about the conduct of some supervisors, including allegations of efforts to "distort crime statistics" to make it appear crime was down.
          She described in the lawsuit how felony thefts were tallied as misdemeanors and also claimed that in 2019, she arrived at the scene of a domestic violence assault involving a knife — which she considered "an unambiguous felony" — but discovered that a lieutenant had downgraded the charge to a misdemeanor of simple assault.
          The city and Djossou settled during summer 2025.

          On August 19, Bondi said some 465 arrests were made in the 12 days since the Trump administration's operations began, an average of 39 arrests a day (the Metropolitan Police Department made an average of 61 arrests per day in 2024).
          On August 27, a Reuters review of more than 500 criminal cases filed in D.C. local court since August 11 found Trump's anti-crime task force was involved in at least 69 local cases over the past two weeks, of which nearly half were comparatively minor offenses, including misdemeanors.
          The rest were felonies under the local D.C. code, not the more serious federal felonies that agencies usually handle and about half of those were for carrying a firearm without a license, possessing drugs with intent to distribute, or both.
          None of the cases Reuters reviewed involved someone being charged with a violent offense.
          From the review it was unclear what the highly paid, specially trained federal agents were contributing other than additional personnel, and only a handful of cases offered details.
          White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers, without providing evidence, said the effort removed more than 1,000 dangerous criminals from the streets in August, including gang members and people who have committed violent crimes, abused children, and sold deadly drugs.

          The video gained national attention and Trump used the the murder to justify plans to expand his crime crackdown in Chicago.

          Judge Bredar said "The sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees' individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct."
          Judge Alsup said "It is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie."
          Earlier in March, the Merit Systems Protection Board ordered 6000 probationary employees at the USDA be reinstated.
          The Trump admin later admitted to firing 24,500 probationary (previously they didn't publicly), and said they began reinstating them on March 18, 2025, but they just placed them on administrative leave instead.
          On Mar 21, Trump's appeal to have Bredar's TRO paused was rejected.

          On April 1, Bredar narrowed his earlier TRO to only apply to the 19 Dem states who were suing Trump in the case, not the entire US as in his earlier ruling.
          On April 8, the Supreme Court paused Alsup's order, saying that some of the plantiffs in the case didn't have standing.
          On April 9, Bredar's TRO was also paused by an appeals court, who said they likely didn't have standing.
          On September 8, an appeals court overturned Bredar's injunction in a 2-1 ruling, saying the states didn't have standing.
          On September 13, Alsup ruled in a preliminary conclusion Office of Personnel Management unlawfully ordered numerous agencies to fire probationary employees en masse, but didn't order them be reinstated due to the Supreme Court decisions.

          Rubio was named as interim replacement and Trump said he would tap Waltz to be his ambassador to the UN.
          Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, an Asia expert who was a State Department official focused on North Korea during Trump's first term, is also being forced from his post.
          The firing came in the wake of the Signalgate scandal and a broader national security purge from the Laura Loomer list.

          Kruse was responsible for the preliminary DIA assessment leaked to the media that said the June 22 U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities had set Tehran's program back only a few months, a finding contradicting Trump's claim that the targets were "obliterated."

          After the tariff announcement, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed is keeping rates on hold, concerned tariffs will drive up inflation.
          Trump responded to this by saying Powell's termination "cannot come fast enough," while calling for the U.S. central bank to cut interest rates, pressure Powell said he would resist.
          Powell's term ends in May 2026, when Trump will get to appoint a new chair.
          In the coming weeks, Trump threatened that he could fire Powell if he wanted to and replace him with Kevn Warsh (former Fed governor) or Kevin Hassett (Trump econ adviser).

          Trump said the Bloomberg report was not true but that he had floated the idea to Republican lawmakers.
          Trump said "I don't rule out anything, but I think it's highly unlikely unless he has to leave for fraud," in reference to OMB director Russell Vought's letter to Powell saying that Trump was "extremely troubled" by the renovations of two Fed buildings, which prompted Powell to request the Fed's inspector general to review the project.

          On July 24, Trump made a rare visit to the Fed to meet Powell amid his continued criticism of the Fed over rates and their renovations.
          Powell typically spends the Thursday afternoon before a rate-setting meeting doing back-to-back calls with Fed bank presidents as part of his preparations for the session.
          During the visit, Trump claimed the renovation project was estimated to cost $3.1 billion, "I am not aware of that," Powell said, shaking his head before Trump handed him a piece of paper, which Powell examined and daid "You just added in a third building," noting that the Martin Building had been completed five years ago.

          The latest policy decision was made by a 9-2 vote, which passes for a split outcome at the consensus-driven central bank, with two Fed governors dissenting for the first time in more than 30 years.

          On August 20, Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign, intensifying his effort to gain influence over the central bank.
          Trump's comments came after U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte alleged in an X post that Cook had designated a condo in Atlanta as her primary residence after taking a loan on her home in Michigan, which she also declared as a primary residence.
          Loans for a primary residence can carry a lower mortgage rate than for second homes or investment properties. 
          Pulte said the loans date to mid-2021, before Cook was appointed to the Fed by Biden.
          Pulte asked AG Bondi to investigate, and Trump quickly amplified the allegation.
          On September 4, the DOJ opened a criminal mortgage fraud probe into Cook.
          The DOJ historically would only pursue cases in which a financial institution suffered significant loss.
          Since 2017, the DOJ has only 20 times charged someone for misstating their primary residences on mortgage applications and of those 20 cases, only one was a standalone criminal charge for misstatements on a mortgage application.

          On August 26, Trump said he was firing Cook "effective immediately" over questions raised over her mortgages.
          Cook's term lasts until 2038 but the Federal Reserve Act allows removal of a sitting governor "for cause," something no President has done before Trump.
          Trump said in a letter to Cook that he had "sufficient cause to remove you from your position" due to the mortgages.
          Cook responded that "no causes exist under the law, and he has no authority" to remove her and that she "will continue to carry out my [her] duties to help the American economy."
          Since Cook was vetted by the Senate already, Trump using her mortgage issues from before her appointment as "for cause" is legally dubious.

          The exemption is meant to give a discount to homeowners on taxes for properties they use as their primary residence.
          The report echoed Pulte's own accusations on multiple primary residencies made against Cook.

          On September 12, Reuters reported that the loan estimate for Cook's Atlanta home shows that she had declared the property as a "vacation home," citing a document from her credit union dated May 2021.
          The document counters other documentation that Pulte cited in support of his claims that she committed mortgage fraud by reporting two different homes as her primary residence.
          Cook also never requested a tax exemption for the Georgia home as a primary residence.
          A separate document (U.S. government national security form known as SF-86) she submitted when obtaining security clearance for her role at the Federal Reserve, shows that in December 2021 she also declared the Atlanta property as a "2nd home."

          Trump said the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 gives him the authority to end collective bargaining with federal unions to safeguard national security.
          Earlier in March, DHS ended a collective bargaining agreement with the tens of thousands of TSA employees.

          There was no way a commissioner could rig the jobs numbers, said William Beach, a former BLS commissioner and co-chair of the group Friends of the BLS.

          The name was chosen in part to signal that in the nuclear age, the U.S. was focused on preventing conflict.

          The shutdown threatened to halt the release of the September employment report, slow air travel, suspend scientific research, withhold pay from U.S. troops and lead to the furlough of 750,000 federal workers at a daily cost of $400 million.
          In an highly unusual overtly partisan move, the HUD displayed a message on their <a href="https://archive.ph/I126B" target="_blank">website</a> reading "The Radical Left in Congress shut down the government. HUD will use available resources to help Americans in need."

            Gavin Klinger is a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Major grad from Berkeley in 2020, he was previously a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks, he also has a substack where he wrote an article "the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies"; Klinger was later found to have retweeted post from Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate in the past.  
            Luke Forritor is a former intern at SpaceX, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for rocket fuel parts, he graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a CS major, he was previously part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll.
            Edward Coristine is only a highschool grad having been enrolled at Northeastern University, he previously spent 3 weeks at Musk's Neuralink last summer, he also previously created 3 tech firms in Connecticut that are valued at $2.4 million by Zillow; it was later disclosed that Coristine had been fired from his previous job at Path Network amid a leaking investigation.

          On June 13, Illston issued a TRO fully blocking the State Dept restructuring plan, saying their defense that the plan was made before the Feb RIF EO was false due to recent department documents citing the EO as a reason for the restructuring.

          On July 8, the Supreme Court lifted Illston's order (Jackson was only dissent), saying the Trump admin was "likely to succeed" in its argument that the mass layoffs were legally within his power. 
          The decision cleared one major legal obstacle for Trump but the court noted that it was not assessing the legality of any specific layoff plans at federal agencies and that they could still face legal challenges.

              The new layoffs brought the total reduction to around 3,000 including the voluntary departures, out of the 18,000 employees in the US.
              Trump's justification for the reduction was his "American First" vision, which included the elimination of top official for civilian security, democracy, and human rights and the closure of some offices that monitored war crimes and conflicts around the world.

              In late July, the U.S. Forest Service faced criticism from current and former employees who say the DOGE layoffs have left fire teams understaffed.
              Since Trump took office, 5,000 employees, roughly 15% of the USFS workforce, quit or were bought out.
              Brooke Rollins said that the agency was on target to hire 11,300 firefighters by mid July, outpacing hiring over the past three years.
              Some former and current USFS employees claim Trump administration workforce cuts have left firefighter support jobs understaffed, leaving firefighters performing non-firefighting duties like cleaning toilets and mowing lawns, while USFS officials maintain they have sufficient resources and are adequately prepared for the fire season.

          Trump subsequently fired the USIP president and installed a loyalist to replace him.
          Trump had also previously fired most of the USIP board on March 14, which they claimed was unlawful due to Trump not giving a reason for the terminations.

          He later revised this to $1 tillion after Trump took office, then to $150 billion a few months into the presidency.
          At the end of May 2025 when Musk left, DOGE claimed $170 billion in savings on their "Wall of Receipts," but this number is disputed due to many of their receipts being riddled with errors.
          According to Treasury data from the time of Jan-May 2025, spent about $250 billion more than the same period the previous year, mostly due to the intrest on debt and Social Security increases.
          Among the agencies DOGE targeted including the State Dept, Dept of Education, USAID, NIH, and the CDC, Treasury data shows their spending was down $19 billion compared to the previous year.
          Also, the BBC did an analysis of the savings and could only verify $32.5 billion in savings due to the remainder of the claimed savings not having receipts attached.

          On May 22, DHS secretary Noem ordered the termination of Harvard student visa program citing alleged antisemitism and coordination with Chinese Communist Party, forcing current foreign students to transfer to other schools or lose their legal status (Harvard enrolled 6,800 international students in the 2024-2025 school year).
          Harvard has had longstanding links to China including research partnerships and China-focused academic centers, which have yielded major financial gifts, influence in international affairs and global prestige for the school.
          An example Republicans use of CCP-Harvard coordination is Harvard providing public health training to Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC) officials after 2020, when the US sanctioned the Chinese paramilitary org for its role in alleged human rights abuses against Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the DHS says Harvard-XPCC have continued "as recently as 2024."
          Another example is that Ronnie Chan, who facilitated a $350 million donation to Harvard in 2014 that led to its school of public health being named for his father, property developer T.H. Chan, is a member of the Hong Kong based China-United States Exchange Foundation, which says its aim is to foster dialogue between the two countries, and has been classified as a foreign principal under US law, requiring U.S. lobbyists working for it to disclose that to the US government.
          Another example if former Harvard professor Charles Lieber, who was convicted in 2021 of lying about his ties to China in connection with federally funded research and now works as a professor at a Chinese university.

          She said the grant terminations were in retaliation against the school in violation of its First Amendment free speech rights.
          Burroughs said it was the job of courts to safeguard academic freedom and "ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to arbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a government committed to its agenda no matter the cost."
          She barred the administration from terminating or freezing any additional federal funding to Harvard and blocked it from continuing to withhold payment on existing grants or refusing to award new funding to the school in the future.

          The pool typically has 10 outlets, that follow the President wherever he goes but Trump is changing it to 30 rotating outlets determined by Karoline Leavitt.
          The three wire services were permanent slot holders due to local news outlets relying on their reporting, due to these local outlets not having a presence in Washington.
          The AP had previously been revomed from the pool due to the Gulf of America spat.

          The Times said Trump's lawsuit has no legitimate legal claims and is an attempt to stifle and discourage independent reporting.

          On April 23, 2025, the DOJ cut 365 grants worth $811 million for supporting crime victims, including for transgender victims; hotlines used by crime victims; grants to fight human trafficking that have gone to organizations working with immigrants; programs to curb juvenile delinquency and safeguard incarcerated youth; and funding for state-run hate-crime reporting. 
          The cuts were authored by Tarak Makecha, a former Tesla employee, who created the list without consulting program managers at the department's Office of Justice Programs.
          Bondi said the cuts reflected the priorities of Trump.
          DOJ grants typically run for 3 years and grant focuses often change from admin to admin, however, grants are rarely cut outright.
          A day after some Reuters reported on the cuts, seven of them were restored including for a program for pet-friendly domestic violence shelters.
          One terminated grant that wasn't restored was $8.3 million to the National Policing Institute, which funded rural police departments and district attorneys' offices to help pay for automated license plate readers, violent crime investigators, investigations against drug dealers for fentanyl overdoses, and programs to combat child sexual abuse.
          Bondi later tweeted examples of "wasteful grants," including a $2 million to "national listening sessions of individuals with lived experience," DOGE quote tweeted with "Great work."
          That $2 million grant trained prosecutors to investigate child abuse in juvenile detention facilities, youth correctional facilities or group homes; the listening sessions allowed prosecutors to hear directly from youth abuse victims.

          Some critics of CVI argue that the programs aren't effective and that the funding should go to better law enforcement while others view the initiatives as inherently "anti-gun" and are used by NGOs to advocate against gun rights.
          However, in June, a letter signed by 18 law enforcement groups and police chiefs in Louisville, Minneapolis, Tucson and Omaha called on Bondi to reinstate funding that has resulted in "measurable and significant reductions in violence and homicides."

          Trump later released a fact sheet refrerring to HBCU-related funding from his first term.
          Between 2021 and 2024, Biden directed $17 billion, including $1.3 billion in 2024 alone.
          As of 2025, many HBCUs still struggle with inadequate infrastructure, lower faculty pay, and limited state investment, especially compared to nearby HWIs.

          The majority suggested the challenge to the terminations should have been brought in a different judicial body, the Washington-based Court of Federal Claims, which specializes in money damages claims against the U.S. government.

          After the lawsuit was filed, the NEA rescinded its initial policy and on April 30 re-implemented Trump's order through a new one under which the NEA's chair would assess grants "for artistic excellence and merit, including whether the proposed project promotes gender ideology," on a "case-by-case" basis.
          While a project deemed to promote "gender ideology" would not be denied funding solely on that basis, that determination could weigh against whether it receives final approval.

          Trump's AI policy shifted from the Biden's approach of considering environmental and equity constraints in favor of a deregulation that only worries about speed.
          Trump's AI policy also marked departure from Biden's "high fence" approach that limited global access to coveted AI chips.

          On August 13, 2025, Navy and Air Force cancelled two nearly complete software projects that took 12 years and well over $800 million combined to develop.
          The reason for the unusual move: officials at those departments, who have so far put the existing projects on hold, want other firms, including Salesforce and billionaire Peter Thiel's Palantir, to have a chance to win similar projects, which could amount to a costly do-over.
          In 2019, Accenture said it had won a contract to expand an HR platform to modernize HR functions for the Air Force with Oracle software.
          The project, which includes other vendors and was later expanded to include Space Force, grew to cost $368 million and was scheduled for its first deployment in summer 2025 at the Air Force Academy.
          An April "status update" on the project conducted by the Air Force described the project as "on track," with initial deployment scheduled for June, noting that it would end up saving the Air Force $39 million annually by allowing it to stop using an older system.
          But on May 30, Darlene Costello, then-Acting assistant Secretary of the Air Force, sent out a memo placing a "strategic pause" on the project for ninety days and calling for the study of alternate technical solutions.

          On June 12, 2025, Trump made a deal with Nippon Steel to sell US Steel to them with the US having a "golden share."
          The golden share meant that Americans would have a 51% share in ownership of the steelmaker.
          The deal was part of an agreement for Japan's Nippon Steel to buy US Steel for $14.9-billion, capping off a tumultuous 18-month effort.
          Lutnick said the share would prevent the companies from reducing or delaying $14 billion in promised investments, transferring production or jobs outside the US, or closing or idling plants before certain time frames, without the president's consent.
          The share also gives Trump veto power over a potential relocation of U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, a transfer of jobs overseas, a name change, as well as other protections relating to "employee salaries, anti-dumping pricing, raw materials and sourcing outside the U.S., acquisitions, and more."
          However, analysts said that the golden share approach is both risky and unprecedented and would make foreign investors wary due to government control in corporate decisions.

          Cadence was run for over a decade by Lip-Bu Tan, a Malaysian-born Chinese American business executive appointed chief executive of Intel in March. 
          Tan was CEO of Cadence from 2008 through December 2021, which includes the period the illegal Chinese sales took place, and was executive chairman until May 2023.

          Tan previously invested at least $200 million in hundreds of Chinese advanced manufacturing and chip firms, some of which were linked to the Chinese military.

          On August 18, the Trump admin said it would discuss taking a 10% stake in Intel that would involve converting some or all of the company's grants from the U.S. Chips and Science Act into equity.
          Some analysts said this could give Intel much-needed breathing room and boost investor confidence; others warn it doesn't fix Intel's deeper issues—like a thin product roadmap, lagging process quality (problems with 18A), and challenges in attracting external foundry customers.
          Risks with the deal are the politicization of corporate decisions, potential mandates favoring Intel for strategic rather than performance-driven reasons, and the danger of undermining industry competitiveness.

          On August 22, Trump said the U.S. would take a 10% stake in Intel under a deal that converts CHIPS Act grants into an equity share.
          Under the agreement, the U.S. will purchase a 9.9% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion, or $20.47 per share, which represents a discount of about $4 from Intel's current share price of $24.80.
          The purchase of the 433.3 million Intel shares will be made with funding from the $5.7 billion in unpaid CHIPS Act grants and $3.2 billion awarded to Intel for the Biden-era Secure Enclave program.
          The government's $8.9 billion investment is in addition to the $2.2 billion in grants Intel has received to date, making for a total investment of $11.1 billion.
          The government's stake is to be passive ownership and does not include a board seat, with the government agreeing to vote with the company's board on matters that need shareholder approval.
          The equity stake also includes a five-year warrant at $20 a share for an additional 5% of Intel stock, which the U.S. can use if Intel loses control of the foundry business.
          Analysts were skeptical on if the deal could save Intel, whih Intel needing external customers for its 18A and 14A manufacturing process, something government cash infusions has not effect on.

          On August 29, Intel said it amended the CHIPS Act funding deal with the Department of Commerce to remove earlier project milestones and received about $5.7 billion in cash sooner than planned.
          The amended agreement retains some guardrails from a November 2024 deal that prevented the chipmaker from using the funds for dividends and buybacks, doing certain control-changing deals and from expanding in certain countries.
          As part of the new deal, Intel issued the U.S. government 274.6 million shares and promised the government the option to buy up to 240.5 million more shares under certain conditions.
          Intel also put 158.7 million shares in an escrow account to be released after the government makes available more CHIPS funds for the Secure Enclave program.

        <li><u>Nvidia-AMD Pay-for-Play Deal</u>
          On August 11, Trump upended decades of U.S. national security policy, creating an entirely new category of corporate risk, when he made a deal with Nvidia to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of its sales in exchange for resuming exports of banned H20 AI chips to China.
          Historically, the U.S. government made decisions to control the export of sensitive technologies on national security grounds, with those decisions viewed as non-negotiable; if a technology was controlled, companies could not buy their way around those controls, no matter how lucrative the foregone foreign sales.
          He also made a similar deal with Nvidia's smaller rival AMD.
          Months earlier, Trump had banned the sale of H20 chips to China, reversing the decision in July as part of what the government said were negotiations on rare earths.

          In 2025, Nvidia sold $23 billion in H20 chips to China and AMD sold another $800 million, with 15% of that being $2 billion.
          Trump claimed that H20 was obsolete, with it not being very good at AI training, however, it is one of the leaders in AI inference and far ahead of the current AI chips China has access to.

          Other companies also set up direct-to-consumer pricing for some of their drugs, to be listed on a new website from U.S. lobby group PhRMA, and raised medicine prices in the UK in line with Trump's desire to offset price decreases in the US.

          The order aimed to leave school policy almost entirely in the hands of states and local boards.
          Trump cannot dismantle the Education Department without Congressional approval, which is unlikely.

          On February 13, 2025, a US District Judge Amir Ali, ordered Trump to restore funding for hundreds of foreign aid contractors.
          The lawsuit was brought by two aid organizations that receive funding from the US government, they argued that Trump's rationale for the freeze, which was to review all aid programs, was not a necessary presursor to achieve his goal.

          On February 25, Ali's ordered for a third time, for the funds to be unfrozen, which the Trump admin appealed, saying it "cannot" meet Ali's deadline (Wed 11:59pm 2/26) to unfreeze the funds.
          The appeal said that the delay in unfreezing was due to a new approval process the Trump admin was using to ensure payments aligned with Trump's agenda, which Ali already ruled was an invalid reason for delaying the payments.

          On August 13, in a 2-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said Judge Ali erred by ordering the Trump admin to restore foreign assistance payments previously approved by Congress and lifted his injunction.

          On September 4, Judge Ali ruled that the administration remains under a duty to comply with appropriations laws unless Congress changes them and cannot choose not to spend roughly $4 billion of the $11.5 billion appropriated in 2024, set to expire on September 30.
          The order came a week after Trump's attempt at a pocket rescission to cut USAID funding.
          Ali said the appeals court left open the ability for the plaintiffs to argue the administration's unilateral decision not to spend funds as Congress directed violated the Administrative Procedure Act.
          On September 5, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled 2-1 to reject Trump's bid to block Judge Ali's ruling.

        <li><u>2024 Human Rights Report</u>
          On August 12, 2025, the Trump admin released the widely anticipated 2024 Human Rights Report of the U.S. State Department, dramatically softening criticism of some countries such as El Salvador and Israel, which rights groups say have extensive records of abuses.
          Instead, the report sounded an alarm on the erosion of freedom of speech in Europe and ramped up criticism of Brazil and South Africa
          Any criticism of governments over their treatment of LGBTQI rights, which appeared in Biden administration editions of the report, appeared to have been largely omitted.
          Washington referred to Russia's invasion of Ukraine mainly as the "Russia-Ukraine war."
          The report's section on Israel was much shorter than last year's edition and contained no mention of the severe humanitarian crisis or death toll in Gaza.
          "There were no credible reports of significant human rights abuses," the 2024 report said about El Salvador.
          That stood in sharp contrast to the 2023 report that talked about "significant human rights issues" and listed them as credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings, torture, and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions.
          In Brazil, where the Trump administration has clashed with the government, the State Department found the human rights situation declined, after the 2023 report found no significant changes.
          In South Africa, whose government the Trump administration has accused of racial discrimination towards Afrikaners, this year's report said the human rights situation significantly worsened.
          In 2023's report, the State Department found no significant changes in the human rights situation in South Africa.

          The money at issue was earmarked for foreign aid, United Nations peacekeeping operations, and democracy-promotion efforts overseas.
          Budget director Russell Vought argued that Trump can withhold funds for 45 days, which would run out the clock until the end of the fiscal year on September 30, a tactic last used in 1977.

          Some 2,000 FEMA employees (a third of full-time staff) have been fired or accepted incentives to quit since Trump took office.
          As part of the FEMA cuts, Trump restricted FEMA travel and speaking engagements, forcing training sessions to move online only, which FEMA said would be ineffective compared to in person trainings.
          On May 15, and internal FEMA document was leaked saying their preparation for hurricane season "has not been normal", "has been derailed this year due to other activities like staffing and contracts", and "an organization hears it should be eliminated or abolished, the resources and cooperation are not there."
          Acting FEMA director Richardson also said during a town hall "FEMA 2 will look different than FEMA 1. There will be much more emphasis on the states to do response and recovery, to some degree preparedness as well."

          Following criticism, which was just days after a gunman killed four people inside of Manhattan skyscraper, FEMA parent agency DHS encouraged cities to tap into a separate pool for funding to cover security needs, known as the State Homeland Security Program.
          However, FEMA was also cutting funding to this program including a 38% year on year funding cut for New York.

        <li><u>2025 Texas Floods</u>
          On July 4, 2025, there were catastrophic flash floods in Texas, killing 78 people including 28 children by July 6.
          The epicenter of the flooding was in Kerr County in Texas Hill Country, where 68 of the deaths were.
          The flooding occurred after the nearby Guadalupe River broke its banks after torrential rain fell in the central Texas area on July 4.
          Officials said on July 5 that more than 850 people had been rescued, including some clinging to trees.
          On July 6, FEMA was deployed after Trump issued a major disaster declaration.
          DHS Secretary Noem, who oversees FEMA and NOAA, said a "moderate" flood watch issued on July 3 by the National Weather Service had not accurately predicted the extreme rainfall.
          The floods caused questioning over if Trump's thousands of job cuts at NOAA, the National Weather Service's parent agency, which left many weather offices understaffed, led to the inaccurate rainfall prediction.

          The most devastating impact of the flooding was at Camp Mystic summer camp, a nearly century-old Christian girls camp, where 27 campers and counselors were among those who perished in the flooding.
          Multiple media outlets reported that Richard "Dick" Eastland, 70, the co-owner and director of Camp Mystic, died trying to save the children at his camp during the flood.

          By July 7, the death toll had surpassed 100 people.
          The same day, Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick vowed that the state would "step up" to pay for installing a flash-flood warning system in Kerrville by next summer if local governments "can't afford it."
          Climate experts also placed some blame for the flooding on climate change saying "Climate change loads the dice toward more frequent and more intense floods."

          In April, 2025, the Trump admin announced it would end the BRIC program calling it wasteful, effective, and politicized.
          In response, 20 mostly Democratic led states sued Trump, saying FEMA had approved about $4.5 billion in grants for nearly 2000 projects and that FEMA lacked the power to cancel the BRIC program without congressional approval.
          On August 5, U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns in Boston issued a preliminary injunction preventing the government from spending money allocated to the BRIC program for other purposes, saying there was an inherent public interest in ensuring that the government follows the law, and the potential hardship to states from the funds being repurposed far outweighed the minimal hardship to the government.

          190 current and former FEMA staff warned Congress in the letter that the inexperience of top appointees of the Trump admin could lead to a catastrophe on the level of Hurricane Katrina.
          Hurricane Katrina was one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, causing catastrophic flooding in New Orleans and devastating destruction along the Gulf Coast in August 2005, claiming the lives of more than 1,800 people.

          Kennedy said the child who died in April died from "a bacteriological infection" but not measles, a common anti-vax tactic, despite Texas health officials saying measles was the cause.
          Kennedy responded by saying outbreaks were not "unusual" and that there were 16 in 2024, rather than emphasizing the need for vaccination, Kennedy later went on to endorse the vaccine as the best way to prevent measles while still advocating for alt-treatments as well.

          Despite the outbreak, on Mar 11, 2025, RFK Jr went on Hannity and said the MMR vaccine causes "deaths every year," despite there being no recorded deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people.
          Later in April 2025, RFK Jr said that measles is always going to be around since the MMR vaccine wanes quickly, despite the MMR vaccine having 97% lifetime effectiveness after 2 doses.
          In 1963 before the vaccine there were 3-4 million measles cases a year, not it is usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.
          High vaccination rates are important because when 95% of people are vaccinated then the community has herd immunity, which protects people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.

            The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
            Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
            In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
            No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
            Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
            Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
            Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.

            On September 12, 2025, HHS announced they intend to directly award a contract to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for investigating the association between vaccines and autism prevalence.

            On September 22, Trump held a press conference with Kennedy where they, where Trump claimed that autism was caused by the MMR vaccine and by pregnant woman using Tylenol.
            Trump's advice goes against that of medical societies, which cite data from numerous studies showing that acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, plays a safe role in the well-being of pregnant women.
            Researchers say there is no firm evidence of a link between the use of Tylenol and autism, with a 2024 study of nearly 2.5 million children in Sweden finding no causal link between in utero exposure to acetaminophen and neurodevelopmental disorders.
            A 2025 review of 46 earlier studies, which Kennedy cited in the conference, did suggest a link between prenatal acetaminophen exposure and increased risks of these conditions, but the researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Harvard University and others said the study does not prove the drug caused the outcomes.
            They advised that pregnant women should continue to use acetaminophen as needed, at the lowest possible dose and for the shortest possible period. 
            Trump's team also suggested leucovorin, a form of folic acid, as a treatment for autism symptoms, running counter to dozens of medical, research, and autism advocacy groups, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, who decried the president's announcement.
            Researchers say leucovorin, used to treat some cancer patients on chemotherapy, has shown some promise in very small trials, but that large, randomized trials are still needed.
            The FDA approved a version of leucovorin for treating autism and said it would be covered by Medicaid.
            The FDA, in its approval process, cited a review of the use of leucovorin in 40 patients with a rare metabolic disorder called cerebral folate deficiency that can lead to a range of neurological symptoms, some of which are seen in people with autism.
            Trump also called for the removal of mercury from vaccines, said children should not get the hepatitis B vaccine before the age of 12 (normally given in the first 24 hours after birth), and said the MMR vaccine should be split into three different parts.

            On June 9, Kennedy fired all 17 members of the ACIP, saying they had conflicts of intrest, despite them having been rigorously vetted by the CDC for conflicts of intrest.
            6 of the fired panel members got $80 or less from drugmakers from 2017-2023, 7 other members got $4000-55000 from drugmakers, and 3 others didn't have their payments tracked.

            The panel reviewed the change to the combined MMRV shot recommendation based on studies showing a higher risk of seizures in children under 4 compared with those who received separate measles-mumps-rubella and varicella shots.
            During the meeting, several committee members objected to the absence of representatives of physician groups and experts who administer vaccines and changes in standard protocols for reviewing and ranking evidence before taking votes.
            Such representatives were removed from work group participation, where such discussions typically occur, and no such work groups were convened to consider the data on either the MMRV or hepatitis B shot.

          The report was found to include 7 studies that didn't exist and misstated conclusions from some studies, both of which the Trump admin said were just "formatting issues."

          That report linked processed foods and over-prescription of medications and vaccines to rising rates of childhood obesity, diabetes, autism, and ADHD.
          It notably stops short of recommending changes to U.S. agrochemical regulatory processes, a key demand of some MAHA activists.

          FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and top U.S. vaccines regulator Vinay Prasad claimed that the benefit of repeated annual shots for healthy adults was uncertain after several years of the virus circulating and vaccines being available.
          Makary and Prasad said the FDA will approve the boosters for adults 65+ years old based on data from immune response testing, the shots will also be available for everyone 6+ months old with one or more high risk severe COVID-19 outcomes.
          However, for healthy people between the ages of six months and 64 years, the FDA will require placebo-controlled clinical trials for approval for annual shots.
          Prasad also said new trials will be necessary every year, just when there are major shifts in the virus.
          Vaccine makers are unlikely to conduct the clinical trials since they would require large enrollment and cost hundreds of millions of dollars.

          On August 6, Kennedy announced 22 projects, totaling $500 million, to develop vaccines using mRNA technology will be halted.
          "To replace the troubled mRNA programs, we're prioritizing the development of safer, broader vaccine strategies, like whole-virus vaccines and novel platforms that don't collapse when viruses mutate,"" Kennedy said.
          "I don't think I've seen a more dangerous decision in public health in my 50 years in the business," said Mike Osterholm, a University of Minnesota expert on infectious diseases and pandemic preparations, noting that mRNA technology offers potential advantages of rapid production, crucial in the event of a new pandemic that requires a new vaccine.
          According to experts, Kennedy's claims ignore how mRNA vaccines work, where he's misguided is that vaccines aim to prevent severe infection and death, not to completely protect from infection in the first place.

          On August 24, 2025, the HHS reported the first human case in the United States of travel-associated New World screwworm.
          The case was originally identified on August 4 in a patient who returned from travel to El Salvador.
          Beef industry sources said the week before that the CDC had confirmed a human case of screwworm in Maryland from someone who had traveled from Guatemala.
          Screwworms are parasitic flies whose females lay eggs in wounds on any warm-blooded animal. 
          Once the eggs hatch, hundreds of screwworm larvae use their sharp mouths to burrow through living flesh, eventually killing their host if left untreated.
          In June, USDA head Brooke Rollins announced plans for a sterile fly facility at Moore Air Force Base in Edinburg, Texas, saying it would take two to three years to come online.
          Screwworms have been traveling north through Mexico from Central America since 2023 and are endemic in Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and countries in South America.
          In July, Mexico reported a new case close to the border upon which the USDA immediately ordered the closure of livestock trade through southern ports of entry, after previously halting imports in November 2024 and May 2025.

          The WH said Monarez was not "aligned with the President's agenda of Making America Healthy Again".
          Monarez's attorneys accused Kennedy of targeting her for refusing to support "unscientific directives" and dismiss health experts, she said Kennedy clashed with her over her refusal to rubber stamp ACIP recommendations.
          The same day, four senior officials resigned over vaccine policy, misinformation, and public health weaponization.
          The officials included Chief Medical Officer Debra Houry, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Director Demetre Daskalakis and National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases Director Daniel Jernigan.
          Following Monarez' firing, Kennedy faced increasing pressure from both sides of the political spectrum, with some Democrats calling for his resignation.
          In a Senate hearing in September, Monarez provided details of the exchange she had with Kennedy before she was fired. 
          On August 25, Kennedy told her that "the childhood vaccine schedule would be changing certainly in September," and Kennedy asked her to commit to approving changes to the vaccine schedule before reviewing scientific evidence.
          Kennedy also directed her to commit in advance to approve every ACIP recommendation, regardless of the scientific evidence, to fire CDC officials responsible for vaccine policy, and he also told her not to speak with U.S. Senators.

      <h3>Corruption</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Eric Adams</u> 
          On February 10, 2025, Bove directed federal prosecutors to drop all corruption charges on NY Mayor Eric Adams, saying the case was impeding his ability to aid Trump on immigration.
          Bove said he didn't question the integrity of the prosecutors who brought the case and had no doubts on the merit of it but said he endorsed the idea that the charges were only brought on Adams because he critisiced Biden's immigration policy.
          Bove said he wanted the charges dropped "without prejudice," so that they could possibly be revived again after the upcoming NY mayoral election amounting to an implicit threat of future prosecution if Adams didn't play ball.
          Adams was federally indicted (means he most likely is guilty) in Sept 2024 for accepting bribes from Turkish officials in exchange for taking pro-Turkey actions.
          Following Adams' indictment, he began forging ties with Trump, inlcuding attending his inaguration at Maralago, leading many to believe he was seeking a pardon.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/justice-department-seeks-dismissal-charges-against-new-york-mayor-ny-times-says-2025-02-10/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On February 13, in the first large controntation in the new Trump presidency, the Manhattan US Attorney, Dannielle Sassoon resigned after rejecting to comply with Bove's order to drop charges on Adams.
          After Sassoon had rejected dismissing the case, Trump's admin directed John Keller, the acting head of the Justice Department's public corruption unit, to do so.
          However, Keller also resigned along with Kevin Driscoll, a senior official in the department's criminal division, three other deputies in the DOJ public corruption unit also resigned.
          Sassoon was picked by Trump to temporarily lead the office prosecuting Adams, she is also a member of the right-leaning Federalist Society and a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
          Sassoon also said she would seek a new indictment accusing Adams of destroying evidence and directing others to do so.
          Bove responded by saying that Sassoon had failed to comply with what he called his office's finding that the case against Adams amounted to "weaponization" of the justice system, saying the DOJ would "not tolerate the insubordination."
          Bove said that the two trial prosecutors on Adam's case would be put on leave and his office would take over the case, moving to dismiss it.
          In a letter to Bondi, Sassoon wrote that she and Bove attended a meeting on Jan 31 in which Adams' lawyers said they mayor could only enforce immigration policies if his charges were dropped, Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, denied any "quid pro quo." 
          The resignations were compared to the "Saturday Night Massacre" in 1973, when senior DOJ officials resigned after refusing Nixon's order to fire the special counsel investigating break-in at the Watergate Democratic headquarters.

          On February 26, Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro asked Ho to dismiss the charges with prejudice, meaning the DOJ could not bring them up again.
          Spiro said in the filing that due to Sassoon's letter being leaked, Adams' would never get a fair trial so the charges must be dropped permanently.

        <li><u>Pausing FCPA</u>
          In a February 10, 2025 executive order, Trump ordered the federal government to stop enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
          The order paused all prosecutions of Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials while trying to win or retain business in their countries.
          The FCPA prohibits companies that operate in the United States from bribing foreign officials.
          Goldman Sachs, Glencore, and Walmart have all faced scrutiny over the FCPA in the past.

          In light of the EO, Trump's admin pushed to halt anti-corruption efforts in the government.
          This included disbanding the task force responsible for sanctioning Russian oligarchs, firing DOJ officials who prosecuted Trump, firing 17 investigator generals, firing the head of the whistleblowers office, and calling for corruption charges on NY Mayor Adams to be dropped.
          Trump's DOJ also dropped charges on Republican congressman, Jeff Fortenberry, who had been awaiting trial on charges accusing him of lying to the FBI, as well as the 2 Trump aids charges along Trump in his documents case.
          The moves showed Trump's willingness to break from having an apolitical justice system in favor of aligning the DOJ with Trump's political agenda.

        <li><u>Reversing Biden Consumer Protections</u>
          On August 13, 2025, Trump revoked Biden executive order 14036 "Promoting Competition in the American Economy" that aimed to promote more competition in the U.S. economy as part of a broad push to rein in what his administration described as a pattern of corporate abuses, ranging from excessive airline fees to large mergers that raised costs for consumers.

          On September 4, Trump dropped a Biden plan to require airlines to pay passengers cash compensation when U.S. flight disruptions are caused by carriers.
          In December 2024, Biden sought public comment on the rulemaking process about whether airlines should be required to pay $200 to $300 for domestic delays of at least three hours and up to $775 for longer delays. 
          U.S. airlines sharply criticized the proposal first made by Biden in May 2023, saying it would only raise ticket prices.
          The Biden admin said the rule "would not only have put real cash back in your hands for badly delayed or canceled flights, but would have resulted in far fewer delayed and canceled flights in the first place."
          Major U.S. carriers in 2022 committed to paying for meals, hotel stays, and other expenses when they cause significant flight disruptions.
          Airlines in the U.S. must refund passengers for canceled flights, but are not required to compensate customers for delays. 
          The European Union, Canada, Brazil and Britain all have airline delay compensation rules.

          On September 21, 2025, it was reported that Trump's border czar Tom Homan accepted a $50,000 bag of cash from an undercover FBI agent as part of a sting operation on Homan.
          In the alleged scheme, Homan promised immigration-related government contracts when he joined the new Trump administration in exchange for the money.
          The probe into Homan started around August 2024, near the end of Biden's term, and stemmed from a separate unrelated national security probe where the target repeatedly brought up Homan, saying he was collecting bribes in exchange for future government contracts.
          FBI Director Kash Patel ordered the investigation closed over the summer, saying there was no evidence Homan had committed a crime and that the investigation was a "blatantly political investigation".
          Homan was an official at ICE under Obama and its acting director during Trump's first term but served in the private sector during Biden's term.
          WH Spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said they rejected the reporting that Homan accepted any such payment and said they backed him "100% because he did absolutely nothing wrong."

          Also on February 5, two separate groups of FBI employees sued the DOJ seeking to protect the identities of agents involved in investigating Trump for Jan 6, following FBI leadership sending a list of Jan 6 investigators to Trump the day before.

          On August 26, U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen threw out an unusual lawsuit the Trump administration filed against every federal judge in Maryland over an order slowing down speedy deportation efforts.
          The DOJ filed the case in June after the Maryland court in May adopted a standing order that automatically blocks for two business days the deportation of migrants in the state who file new habeas lawsuits challenging their detention.
          Cullen said the judges are "immune from suit," and that Trump "fails to identify a legitimate cause of action that allows it to bring this lawsuit."
          Cullen, whom Trump appointed in 2020, also wrote that it was unfortunate that the Trump admin used words like "rogue," "unhinged," and "radical" to describe federal judges across the country.

          The indictment alleges that Comey misled Congress by claiming he had not authorized anyone else to be an anonymous source in news reporting about an FBI investigation.
          The week prior, the prosecutor in the case, Erik Siebert, resigned and others in the office told his successor, former Trump personal lawyer Lindsey Halligan, not to pursue the charges due to lack of evidence.

        <li><u>FBI Retribution Lawsuit</u>
          On September 10, 2025, Former FBI acting director Brian Driscoll and two other former senior officials (Steve Jensen, former assistant director of the Washington field office, and Spencer Evans, former top official in the Las Vegas field office) who were fired without cause the month prior, sued the Trump admin, alleging they were dismissed in a "campaign of retribution" that targeted officials viewed as insufficiently loyal.
          The lawsuit alleged that FBI Director Kash Patel said "The FBI tried to put the president in jail and he hasn't forgotten it," before ordering the firing of anyone who had worked on a criminal investigation against President Trump, and that Driscoll's own job depended on their removal.
          Driscoll temporarily served as the FBI's director early in 2025, and sought to shield FBI employees who had been investigating January 6.
          Driscoll is widely seen by rank and file agents as a hero who pushed back against the DOJ efforts target people who worked on January 6 investigations.
          Driscoll alleged that while he was being vetted ahead of Trump's inauguration, he was asked by White House staffer, Paul Ingrassia, about "when did you start supporting President Trump" and whether he had voted for Democratic candidates in the last five elections, questions he refused to answer.
          Driscoll said he was told later that evening by Emil Bove that he had "failed" the vetting interview and that Ingrassia had reported that he was not "based out" enough - a term he understood to mean loyalty to Trump's political ideology.
          However, Driscoll was still allowed to temporarily serve as deputy acting FBI director during the transition, upon which Driscoll alleged that Bove said he was under pressure from Stephen Miller to see "symmetrical action at the FBI as had been happening at DOJ," in a reference to the firings of officials involved in Trump-related cases.
          Shortly after, Bove asked for the names of FBI employees who worked in the Washington, Miami and Las Vegas offices, as well as those who worked on the January 6 investigations, which Driscoll resisted, causing Bove to accuse Driscoll of insubordination.
          When Driscoll and Robert Kissane (acting FBI director at the time) told Bove that employees were feeling anxiety from the pressure campaign, Bove said that "was the intent."

          On April 25, 2025, the DOJ began allowing prosecutors in criminal investigations to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to compel "production of information and testimony by and relating to members of the news media."
          The directive reverses a Biden DOJ policy that barred prosecutors from seizing reporters' phone and email records in most circumstances, following criticism of the DOJ for secretly subpoenaing records on reporters and congressional staff members as prosecutors pursued leaks of national security information during Trump's first term.
          Some of the most consequential reporting in U.S. history — from Watergate to warrantless wiretapping after 9/11 — was and continues to be made possible because reporters have been able to protect the identities of confidential sources.

          The civil fraud case, brought forward in 2022, resulted in a $355 million judgment against Trump in 2024 after a judge found he fraudulently overstated his net worth to dupe lenders as he built his real estate empire.

          The department has also named Ed Martin, whose nomination to be the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., faltered amid opposition from some Republican senators, as a special attorney to investigate James for allegations of mortgage fraud.
          Legal decisions are often appealed, but it is highly unusual for a prosecutor to face a criminal investigation over legal cases, especially those that have gone to trial and been sustained by courts.

          The DOJ previously maneuvered to keep Habba in her post and circumvent a judicial decision not to extend her 120-day interim tenure.
          The DOJ fired Desiree Grace, a career prosecutor who was selected by the court to replace Habba, and the White House said Trump preemptively removed her as U.S. attorney.
          The department is using similar tactics to evade judicial intervention and temporarily keep at least three other U.S. attorneys aligned with Trump in their roles.

          The protests occurred on the same day of Trump's birthday, and the same day he was holding an unusual military parade in D.C.
          The protests turned out about 5 million people, making it the 3rd largest single-day protest in the US at the time.
          The protests were organized by progressive groups including the ACLU, MoveOn, and American Opposition.
          Major cities such as Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia saw large-scale demonstrations, and sizable protests occurred in smaller cities and suburban locales.
          The majority of protests were peaceful but some were deemed unlawful assemblies including in Los Angeles and Seattle, where police used tear gas and batons to scatter protesters.

        <li><u>Partisan Redistricting</u>
          On August 3, 2025, Texas Democratic lawmakers left the state in order to deny Republicans the quorum needed to redraw the state's 38 congressional districts.
          Trump championed the redistricting plan that was expected to yield as many as five additional House Republicans in the 2026 midterms, at the time Republicans held a narrow 220-212 majority in the house with three Democratic held seats vacant from Texas following one member's death.
          States are required to redistrict every 10 years based on the U.S. Census but the Texas map was passed just four years ago by the Republican-dominated legislature. 
          While mid-cycle redistricting occasionally takes place, it is usually prompted by a change in power at the legislature.

          On August 4, Texas Governor Abbott ordered the Texas Department of Public Safety to locate, arrest, and return the house members, with the number of lawmakers out of state rising to more than 50.
          The same day, California Governor Gavin Newsom said he was preparing a rare mid-decade congressional redistricting plan for their own state that would offset the Republican gains from a redrawn Texas map.

          On August 5, Abbott filed an emergency lawsuit asking the state Supreme Court to remove state Representative Gene Wu, the House Democratic caucus chair, from office, arguing he abandoned his seat by fleeing the state.
          The same day, Trump told reporters late that the FBI "may have" to get involved in forcing Democrats back to Texas.

          On August 8, Newsom said he will ask voters to approve a ballot measure in November 2025 redrawing the state's congressional map in a way likely to create five more Democratic seats.
          The same day, Texas House of Representatives Speaker Dustin Burrows put the absent Democratic lawmakers on notice that they can only collect their paychecks by appearing in person at the capitol in Austin.

          On August 18, the Texas Democratic lawmakers returned to the state, ending a two-week walkout that broke quorum.
          Texas House of Representatives Minority Leader Gene Wu, said Democrats returned because they had achieved their two main goals: (1) to block a vote on new congressional maps in the first special legislative session and (2) to prompt California and other Democratic-led states to consider redrawing their own maps.
          Other Republican states including Ohio, Florida, Indiana and Missouri were also moving forward with or considering their own redistricting efforts, as were Democratic states such as Maryland and Illinois.
          After they returned to the statehouse, the Republicans assigned state law enforcement officers to monitor the Democrats' movement.
          Democratic state Representative Nicole Collier spent the night in the Texas Capitol building rather than agree to a police monitor.

          A 2018 ballot proposition had created an independent redistricting commission to recommend congressional maps but the current map in Utah was adopted in 2021.

          In an unusual statement, Newsmax said it chose to settle because the Delaware judge handling the case (Judge Eric Davis) was prejudiced against the company, and it stood by its coverage as fair and balanced.
          Newsmax also paid $40 million to settle allegations brought by another voting machine company, Smartmatic, in a separate case that was also overseen by Davis.
          While Davis said damages would be determined by a jury trial that was expected in late 2025, Newsmax said he refused to let the jury hear that Fox News agreed to pay $787.5 million to Dominion in 2023 to settle similar defamation claims and that information was critical for the jury to understand that Dominion had already been compensated.

        <li><u>Nevada Voter Fraud Conspiracy</u>
          On September 30, Nevada Acting U.S. Attorney, Sigal Chattah, revealed she asked the FBI to investigate Republican claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election, a probe she hopes will influence congressional races and ensnare Democrats.
          She said she gave investigators a thumb drive containing data compiled by Nevada's Republican Party about people living in the U.S. illegally who cast ballots in the 2020 election and members of Indian tribes who allegedly received cash for ballots, and also urged the agents to call the state's Republican Party attorney.
          Chattah said her goal was to remove "illegal aliens" from voter rolls, possibly leading to "reallocation of census numbers" and affect the race for Nevada's 4th congressional district seat, and also wants to exonerate the six Republicans who were prosecuted by Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford for posing as fake electors for Trump in 2020.
          Chattah has multiple conflicts of interest that potentially violate ethics rules including her prior work as an attorney representing certain Republican clients and as Nevada's RNC chairwoman.
          Impartiality rules also generally prohibit government lawyers from working for a year on any matter involving a former employer or legal client.
          In 2020, Chattah echoed Trump's false election fraud claims but the Nevada Republican Party tried in 2021 to present evidence of voter fraud to the state, but the state concluded that most of the complaints related to voter registration records were "inaccurate or suspicious for a variety of reasons."

          However, also on September 30, U.S. District Judge David Campbell found that Chattah is not validly serving as acting U.S. Attorney and therefore "her involvement in these cases would be unlawful," referring to four criminal cases she was leading.
          Chattah was appointed in late March to serve a 120-day stint as interim U.S. attorney but when her appointment was about to expire on July 26, the Trump admin extended her appointment under a different federal law, making her acting U.S. attorney, a move that effectively front-ran the U.S. District Court from being able to appoint someone to serve in the role.

        <li><u>Epstein Files</u>
          In February 2025, far-right twitter influencers were invited to the White House and provided with binders marked "The Epstein Files: Phase 1" and "Declassified" that contained documents that had largely already been in the public domain, leading to internet backlash.
          After the release flopped, in a March TV interview, Bondi claimed the Biden administration "sat on these documents, no one did anything with them," adding: "Sadly these people don't believe in transparency, but I think more unfortunately, I think a lot of them don't believe in honesty."
          On July 7, the DOJ said Epstein didn't have a client list and that no more files related to the wealthy financier's sex trafficking investigation would be made public despite promises from Attorney General Pam Bondi that had raised the expectations of conservative influencers and conspiracy theorists.
          Bondi suggesting in a Fox News interview earlier that year that such a document was "sitting on my desk" for review.
          FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino have also insisted in television and podcast interviews that the evidence was clear that Epstein had killed himself.
          They also released a video from outside Epstein's jail cell as proof he actually killed himself.
          Bondi cited the existence of "tens of thousands" of videos that she said showed Epstein "with children or child porn" as the reason for no more public releases, despite multiple people who participated in the criminal cases of Epstein and socialite former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell saying they had not seen and did not know of a trove of recordings along the lines of what Bondi had referenced. 
          Indictments and detention memos also don't allege the existence of video recordings and neither Epstein nor Maxwell were charged with possession of child sex abuse material even though that would have been easier for prosecutors to prove than the sex trafficking counts they faced.

          After the July 7 memo, Trump had to deal with the fallout on Twitter from his conspiracy brained followers, who were calling for Bondi to be fired.
          Trump chose to stand with Bondi, saying "I don't understand why the Jeffrey Epstein case is of interest to anybody," and urging his followers to just move on.

          On July 17, Trump asked for a release of grand jury testimony from the Epstein case but also said he would not recommend appointing a special prosecutor on the case.
          U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida on July 23 denied the administration's request to unseal records from the grand jury investigations in 2005 and 2007 finding that the request did not fall into any of the limited exceptions that may allow for the release of such material.
          Manhattan-based U.S. District Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer responded to the DOJ and asked them to flesh out the legal bases for the requests.
          On July 30, the DOJ responded saying unsealing the materials would be appropriate given the "abundant public interest" in the Epstein case and persistent scrutiny of how it was handled by federal law enforcement.

          The day before, the WSJ reported on a letter bearing Trump's name was part of a leather-bound birthday book for Epstein that included messages from other high-profile people.
          The WSJ said the letter had typewritten text framed by the outline of a naked woman, which appeared to be hand-drawn with a heavy marker and that the the letter concluded "Happy Birthday - and may every day be another wonderful secret," featuring the signature "Donald."

          On July 23, the WSJ reported that Bondi told Trump in May that his name and "many other high-profile figures" appeared in Epstein investigative files.
          The White House sent mixed signals by initially saying the report was "fake news," but a White House official later told Reuters the administration was not denying that Trump's name appears in some files, noting that Trump was already included in the February documents for conservative influencers.
          The same day, U.S. District Judge Robin Rosenberg denied the DOJ's request for grand jury documents, saying that it did not fall into any of the exceptions to rules requiring grand jury material be kept secret.
          Also on the same day, the House Oversight Committee approved 8-2 a subpoena seeking all DOJ files on Epstein.

          On July 24 and 25, Deputy Attorney General and former personal lawyer to Trump, Todd Blanche met with Ghislaine Maxwell for interviews on more info about the Epstein case.
          The meeting was highly unusual, as senior officials typically do not personally conduct investigative interviews.
          When asked if he would consider a pardon for Maxwell, Trump said "It's something I haven't thought about."
          On August 22, the trascript from the Blanche-Maxwell interviews was released, where Maxwell said she was not aware of any "client list" belonging to the late financier and never saw President Donald Trump behave inappropriately.
          She also said she only ever worked with Bill Clinton on his philanthropic endeavors, and that he used Epstein's plane for a trip to Africa but that Clinton never visited Epstein's private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

          "The materials do not identify any person other than Epstein and Maxwell as having had sexual contact with a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstein's or Maxwell's," Engelmayer wrote.
          On August 20, Judge Berman rejected the DOJ bid to have grand jury documents unsealed, saying that the 70-odd pages of materials the grand jury saw paled in comparison to the 100,000 pages the government had but is not releasing.
          Berman also said the bid to persuade him to unseal the records was an apparent distraction from the DOJ's decision in July not to release its files.

        <li><u>Obama Treason</u>
          On July 18, 2025, Tulsi Gabbard declassified documents and said the information she was releasing showed a "treasonous conspiracy" in 2016 by top Obama administration officials to undermine Trump and threatened to refer the officials to the DOJ.
          However, Gabbard conflated two separate U.S. intelligence findings in alleging that Obama had changed an assessment that Russia probably was not trying to influence the election through cyber means.
          One finding was that Russia was not trying to hack U.S. election infrastructure to change vote counts and the second was that Moscow probably was using cyber means to influence the U.S. political environment through information and propaganda operations, including by stealing and leaking data from Democratic Party servers.
          In January 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment ordered by Obama built on that second finding: that Putin authorized influence operations to sway the 2016 vote to Trump.
          On July 22, amid the Epstein fallout, Trump accused Obama of "treason" for leading an effort to falsely tie him to Russia and undermine his 2016 presidential campaign.
          Trump said, "It's time to start, after what they did to me, and whether it's right or wrong, it's time to go after people. Obama has been caught directly."
          Obama denounced Trump's claims, saying "these bizarre allegations are ridiculous and a weak attempt at distraction."
          On July 2, CIA director Ratcliffe found flaws in the production of the January 2017 assessment but did not contest its conclusion and upheld "the quality and credibility" of a highly classified CIA report on which the assessment's authors relied.

          In February 2025, Trump signed an EO to establish the "National Energy Dominance Council" upon which he assigned the DOJ to assist the EPA in rescinding $20 billion in grants awarded under Biden for climate and clean energy projects.
          In connection with this, Trump asked the head of the criminal division at the AG's office, Denise Cheung, to open a criminal grand-jury investigation for wire fraud and conspiracy into one of these contracts awarded under Biden.
          Cheung refused to open the investigation, citing lack of evidence, upon which she was ordered instead to pursue an asset seizure to prevent the recipient of the contract from getting funding.
          Cheung consulted with the FBI before deciding to recommend a "30-day administrative freeze on certain assets," which the Trump admin told her was no adequate and again demanded a full freeze and asked her to resign.
          On February 18, Cheung announced her resignation after 24 years with the DOJ.

          Chutkan said that the EPA had asserted substantial fraud, waste, and abuse with the contracts but only provided vague assertions to back up that claim. 
          The grants were terminated as part of Zeldin's campaign to claw back money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, aimed at curbing pollution.

        <li><u>New Mexico Drive-by Shootings</u>:
          On March 20, 2025, failed NM Republican state House candidate, Solomon Pena, was found guilty for soliciting a series of drive-by shootings at the homes of Democrat officials in Albuquerque.
          Pena recruited others to carry out the shootings after he falsely accused the Dem officials of defeating him due to election fraud.

        <li><u>Israel embassy aides killed</u>
          On May 21, 2025, a lone gunman opened fire with a handgun outside of a Jewish museum in Chicago as people were leaving an event for young professionals and diplomats hosted by the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group that fights antisemitism and supports Israel.
          In the shooting, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim, both Israeli Embassy staffers and a young couple about to become engaged to be married, were killed. 
          The gunman was Elias Rodriguez, who was charged with two counts of first degree murder for the killings.
          Surveillance video showed Rodriguez firing several times at Lischinsky and Milgrim, then leaning over them to fire several more rounds after they fell to the ground and after Milgrim tried to crawl away and sat up, then he paused to reload and resumed firing.
          Rodriguez told police on the scene, "I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza" and chanted "Free Palestine" after he was taken into custody.
          Rodriguez also posted a manifesto on social media the day before the shooting, titled "Escalate For Gaza, Bring The War Home," it condemned Israel's killing of tens of thousands of Palestinians since the October 2023 Hamas attacks, and discussed the morality of "armed" action.
          Rodriguez was once involved with the far-left Party for Socialism and Liberation that ended in 2017, the PSL said they had nothing to do with the attack and do not support it.
          Rodriguez was also identified in a 2018 local news report as a member of the Chicago branch of a national group called ANSWER (Act Now to Stop War and End Racism), which has organized demonstrations in solidarity with Palestinians.
          Trump and Netanyahu both condemned the shooting as antisemetic.

          On August 6, Rodriguez was indicted by a federal grand jury on 9 counts including federal hate crime charges, first degree murder, and murder of a foreign official, with a special finding that makes him eligible for the death penalty if convicted.
          The indictments allege that Rodriguez had a history of violent rhetoric online against Israelis, including a plea to "vaporize every Israeli 18 and above."
          On September 4, Rodriguez plead not guilty to all nine counts.

        <li><u>Minnesota lawmakers killed</u>
          On June 14, 2025, Minnesota Police and the FBI issued a manhunt after a man posing as a police officer killed former Minnesota State House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, before fleeing on foot after getting in a fire-fight with law enforcement.
          The suspect was identified as Vance Luther Boelter, who also seriously wounded Minnesota state Senator John Hoffman and his wife after shooting them multiple times before going to the Hortman's. 
          Police found Boether's abandoned vehicle, disguised as a police SUV, where they found a "manifesto" and a target list of about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states. 
          The list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats including Walz, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, Senator Tina Smith and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.
          In response to the events, the organizing No Kings Coalition canceled all protests in Minnesota (shooting was on same day as Trump birthday parade), citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect's at-large status.
          "Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!" Trump said in response to the killings.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/minnesota-state-lawmakers-shot-search-underway-suspect-local-media-reports-say-2025-06-14/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On June 16, police finally found and arrested Boelter.
          According to social media postings, Boelter had links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa.
          Boelter was charged on state charges with two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of second-degree attempted murder.
          In speaking to the New York Times, Boelter was deeply conservative Christian, saying "Because I love my neighbors prior to June 14th I conducted a 2 year long undercover investigation."
          Boelter had also written to himself, "Doing what most people know needs to be done ... but are not willing to do it themselves."
          In 1985, Boelter went from being a baseball loving teenager in college to becoming a deeply religious "hypnotic zombie."
          Boelter later graduated from unaccredited Christ for the Nations in 1990 and returned to Minnesota to start a ministry, then returned to St. Cloud State University, earning a degree in international relations in 1996.
          Over the years Boelter took on many jobs, moving his wife and five kids from state to state along with him.
          In 2021, Mr. Boelter and his wife founded a venture called Red Lion Group, which focused on business and Christian-outreach opportunities in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
          In a 2023 sermon he gave in the Congo, he said "they don't know abortion is wrong in many churches."
          In the late summer of 2023, Mr. Boelter began collecting bodies for one funeral home in the Twin Cities area, and then a second — "to pay the bills."
          In February 2025, Boelter abruptly quit his job delivering bodies and returned to the Congo.
          According to Boelter's best friend, in the months before the murders, he developed a strong distrust of government, especially Democrats, believing that the criminal prosecutions of Trump were politically motivated, and that a victory by Kamala Harris would lead to civil war. 
          He also began following the Infowars website and watching Alex Jones.
          Boelter then planned for weeks, compiling a list of targets, before executing the attacks on June 14.
          In a rambling, largely incoherent letter Mr. Boelter wrote to the F.B.I. director, Kash Patel, shortly before his arrest, he claimed the shootings were part of a dark political conspiracy involving Minnesota's governor and the state's senate seats.
          "No one was aware of what I was investigating, not my wife, family, friends or co-workers," he told The Times. 
          "That is why many are having a very tough time understanding what is going on."

          Later on June 16, Boelter appeared in court where it was revealed he visited 4 other legislators homes on the night og the killings.
          The affidavit said Boelter planned the attack for some time with his notebook containing the names and, in some cases, home addresses for more than 45 elected officials, "mostly or all Democrats."

          On June 17, Trump said he would not call Minnesota Governor Waltz about the shooting.
          Trump said "I think the governor of Minnesota is so whacked out. I'm not calling him. Why would I call him?"
          and "The guy doesn't have a clue. He's a mess. So I could be nice and call him, but why waste time?"
          Trump also repeated false statements that originated from Benny Johnson, DC_Draino and Mike Cernovich that Boelter was close to Mike Walz due to Waltz reappointing Boelter in 2019 to a state board focused on Minnesota's workforce.
          Walz said the governor's office appoints thousands of people of all political affiliations to legislature-created unpaid, external boards and commissions.
          Democratic Gov. Mark Dayton, who served from 2011 to 2019, appointed Boelter as a "private sector representative" on the Governor's Workforce Development Board.
          On Dec. 9, 2019, Walz reappointed Boelter to serve on the group as a "business member." The board — which has about 60 members, 41 of whom are appointed by the governor — analyzes and recommends to the governor and state Legislature workforce policies related to things such as talent development or addressing barriers to employment — to help Minnesota maintain a globally competitive labor force, according to its website.
          Boelter's most recent term on the board expired Jan. 2, 2023.
          However, this didn't stop twitter conservatives from running with the theory that Walz personnaly ordered the assassinations due to Hortman and Hoffman "both recently voted against their party, with Hortman supporting repeal of free healthcare for illegals and Hoffman joining Republicans in the Senate to pass it."
          Hortman was the only Democrat who voted with Republicans to pass the budget bill that would remove adult immigrants in the U.S. illegally from the state's MinnesotaCare health program but Hoffman voted against the bill that would end such coverage.

        <li><u>Manhattan NFL Shooting</u>
          On July 28, 2025, Shane Tamura, a 27-year-old Las Vegas resident with a history of mental illness struggles, killed four people in a shooting rampage at a Midtown Manhattan office building.
          Tamura used an M4 Carbine semi-automatic rifle during the shooting before taking his own life.
          Tamura was carrying a note, blaming the NFL for his degenerative brain disease (CTE).
          Tamura was never an NFL player, but online records show he played in high school.
          Tamura appeared to have driven to New York City from Las Vegas over three days and to have acted alone, New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said.
          The NFL has its headquarters in the skyscraper, but Tamura apparently entered the wrong elevator bank and ended up in the offices of Rudin Management, a real estate company, where he shot employees.
          Among those killed was a Blackstone senior executive Wesley LePatner (Blackstone's headquarters is in the same tower) and NYPD officer, Didarul Islam, 36, who came from Bangladesh and had been on the force three years.

          On August 27, 2025, a shooting occurred at the Annunciation Church, which is also home to an elementary school with students from preschool through eighth grade.
          The assailant was armed with three guns (rifle, shotgun and pistol, all legally and recently purchased) and fired through stained-glass windows into the Catholic church where parish school students were attending Mass, killing two children (aged 8 and 10) and wounding 17 other people.
          The shooting took place on the first week back to school during an all-school Mass held annually on the first Wednesday of the academic year.
          FBI Director Kash Patel said they were investigating the attack as an "act of domestic terrorism and hate crime targeting Catholics."
          The lone suspect was identified as Robin Westman, 23, who "took his own life" at the rear of the church following the attack.
          A 2017 yearbook from the school showed that Westman, who went by the first name Robert at the time, had been a student there.
          In an online video posted on YouTube by Westman, she showed the text of a suicide note expressing feeling depressed and wanting to carry out a mass shooting, having names of previous school shooters scrawled on a rifle magazine, along with erratic and wide-ranging political grievances, and also a belief that death was near because of a vaping habit.
          Westman's writings included anti-Catholic prejudice and a call for the killing of U.S. President Donald Trump
          DHS Secretary Kristie Noem said the suspect was "claiming to be transgender," and court records showed Westman's name was changed from Robert in 2020 because Westman identified as female. 
          Trump ordered U.S. flags to be flown at half-staff nationwide as a sign of mourning.

          Following the shooting, conservatives online were quick to blame the attack on Westman's "transgender identity" and called for trans people to be barred from owning guns.
          The online rhetoric echoed similar claims made by Donald Trump Jr. following the 2023 Nashville private school shooting where the shooter was identified as transgender and conservatives began <a href="https://archive.ph/pnSqs" target="_blank">saying</a> "the modern trans movement is radicalizing activists into terrorists."
          By March 2023, there had been four shootings involving trans/nonbinary shooters including: one in November 2020 at a gay nightclub in Colorado Springs; a 2019 shooting at a Denver-area school by two shooters, one of them a trans man; a 2018 shooting at a Maryland warehouse; and the Nashville school shooting.
          Using the Gun Violence Archive (mass shooting meaning at least four gun injuries), there have been more than 4,400 mass shootings between 2013-2023, with the number of trans shooters being less than 10, translating to 0.11% of the total shootings.
          Further, in a U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center (NTAC) report with data from 2016 to 2020 that examined 173 attacks in the U.S. "that resulted in harm to three or more individuals in public locations," found that of the 173 attacks, three of the attackers were trans, five were female, and the rest were male.
          As of August 2025, 1.0% of those aged 13 and older in the US (2.8 million people) <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Trans-Pop-Update-Aug-2025.pdf" target="_blank">identify</a> as transgender.

          On September 10, 2025, conservative activist Charlie Kirk, 31, was <a href="https://x.com/stillgray/status/1965854630623195444" target="_blank">shot</a> and killed while hosting a debate event at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah.
          Kirk was an Illinois native who founded the conservative student group Turning Point USA when he was 18 and went on to become a rising star in the Republican Party under Trump, drawing 500,000 monthly podcast listeners and amassing 5.3 million X followers.
          Turning Point USA is an organization dedicated to advancing conservative causes on college campuses and was instrumental in driving youth support for Trump in the 2024 election.
          The Utah governor described Kirk's death as a "political assassination," despite there being no suspect or motive yet determined.
          After the shooting Trump posted on Truth, "He was loved and admired by ALL, especially me, and now, he is no longer with us."
          Trump ordered flags flown at half-staff in Kirk's honor and said he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
          JD Vance canceled his trip to New York to commemorate the 9/11 attacks, and instead traveled to Utah to see Kirk's family and to fly them and Kirk's casket home to Arizona aboard Air Force Two.
          Kirk left behind two young children and his wife.
          Seconds before he was shot Kirk was being questioned by an audience member about gun violence, "Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America in the last 10 years?"
          He responded, "Counting or not counting gang violence?" moments before being shot.
          Awareness of Kirk's shooting spread faster than past news events because observers filmed videos from multiple angles and posted them on video-based platforms.

          Kirk's rhetoric, which often involved anti-LGBTQ and anti-immigrant comments, engendered strong feelings.
          Moments before he was killed Charlie was taking a question about transgender people and mass shootings.
          "Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?" the event attendee asked.
          "Too many," Kirk replied.
          In debates across the country, on college campuses, podcasts and on X, Kirk seemed to relish confrontation, casting himself as a champion of free speech and the open exchange of ideas.
          He occasionally struck conciliatory notes, telling Tucker Carlson in a July interview: "How do we actually de-radicalize the country in the next couple of years? That's my obsession."
          The day pop star Taylor Swift announced her engagement to NFL player Travis Kelce, Kirk <a href="https://x.com/mmfa/status/1960416119782518874" target="_blank">told</a> her, "you're not in charge," urging her to "reject feminism" and "submit to your husband."
          Kirk dismissed affirmative action and diversity, equity and inclusion programs and people he perceived as having benefited from them.
          "MLK was awful," Kirk <a href="https://archive.ph/FP0MD" target="_blank">said</a>. 
          "He's not a good person. He said one good thing he actually didn't believe ... I have a very, very radical view on this, but I can defend it, and I've thought about it," Kirk said at America Fest. 
          "We made a huge mistake when we passed the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s." 
          Kirk argues that the Civil Rights Act, ushered in a "permanent DEI-type bureaucracy."
          On a July 2023 episode of his show, he said TV personality Joy Reid, former First Lady Michelle Obama, the late Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson did not have the intelligence to achieve what they did without affirmative action. 
          "You had to go steal a white person's slot to be taken somewhat seriously," he <a href="https://x.com/alluring_nyc/status/1965931096539017536" target="_blank">said</a>.
          Kirk also opposed transgender rights and his organization sponsored rallies against transgender medical care.
          In April 2024, he <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/charlie-kirk/charlie-kirk-we-need-have-nuremberg-style-trial-every-gender-affirming-clinic-doctor" target="_blank">likened</a> doctors who perform gender-affirming care to Nazis committing atrocities.
          "One issue I think that is so against our senses, so against the natural law and dare I say a throbbing middle finger to God, is the transgender thing happening in America right now," he <a href="https://x.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1701335984309223455" target="_blank">said</a> during a speech posted in 2023 by Right Wing Watch.
          In the same speech, he cited a Bible verse saying that a woman who puts on men's clothes or a man who puts on a woman's garment is an "abomination."
          During his show in April 2022, he <a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/media/3986864/embed/embed" target="_blank">argued</a> that gay couples "are not happy just having marriage. Instead, they now want to corrupt your children."
          After January 6, 2021, when many Republicans thought Trump's political career was over, Kirk <a href="https://x.com/girlsreallyrule/status/1348603383968649216" target="_blank">embraced</a> the Stop the Steal movement claiming the 2020 election was stolen by Democrats.

          At the same time of the Kirk assassination, there was also a mass shooting at Evergreen High School near Denver.
          The county was the same one as the 1999 Columbine High School massacre that killed 14 people.
          The shooter, student Desmond Holly, died of self-inflicted wounds after wounding two others.
          Holly was a 16-year-old boy who had been radicalized by an unspecified "extremist network" and used a revolver in the shooting.
          Holly was later found to have been active on an online forum where users watch videos of killings and violence (Watch People Die), mixed in with content on white supremacism and antisemitism.
          Holly's TikTok accounts also contained white supremacist symbols.
          A few days before the shooting, Holly posted a TikTok video posing in a similar way to how a recent December 2024 Wisconsin shooter posed before killing two people, including a photo of the Wisconsin shooter in a post in which Holly wore black T-shirt with “WRATH” written on the front.

          The day of the shooting, the House observed a "moment of prayer for Charlie Kirk and his family" at the request of Speaker Mike Johnson. 
          A subsequent request for a "moment of prayer out loud" elicited vocal objections and chaos on the House floor. 
          Footage shows members standing silently for about 30 seconds. 
          Johnson then bangs his gavel and Rep. Lauren Boebert says that "silent prayers get silent results" before requesting that someone lead a spoken prayer as well. 
          An audible "no" can be heard in response, among other protests. 
          Shouting continues for about a minute, requiring Johnson to bang his gavel and state, "the House will be in order" several times. 
          Many posts claiming that Democrats had opposed a moment of prayer for Kirk shared clips that omitted Johnson's initial request and the ensuing silence.

          His death left many conservatives seething and blaming liberals for the assault, while Democrats largely kept to a more reserved tone, decrying political violence generally and again calling for stronger gun laws.
          White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said "All of us must now dedicate ourselves to defeating the evil that stole Charlie from this world."
          MAGA loyalist Laura Loomer called for "cracking down on the Left with the full force of the government. Every single Left wing group that funds violent protests needs to be shut down and prosecuted. No mercy."
          Elon Musk was even more blunt, saying "The Left is the party of murder."
          Trump - who routinely refers to his political rivals as "radical left lunatics" who he warns represent an existential threat to America - called the shooting an outgrowth of overheated rhetoric saying, "Violence and murder are the tragic consequence of demonizing those with whom you disagree - day after day, year after year - in the most hateful and despicable way possible."
          However, Trump decided to fan the flames, going on to say "For years, those on the radical left have <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-harris-fascist-jd-vance-b2614984.html" target="_blank">compared</a> wonderful Americans like Charlie to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-social-media-account-shares-and-deletes-video-referencing-a-unified-reich" target="_blank">Nazis</a> and the world's worst mass murderers and criminals ... This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we're seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now."
          The reaction from Democrats was more muted, with Obama saying, "We don't yet know what motivated the person who shot and killed Charlie Kirk, but this kind of despicable violence has no place in our democracy."
          Democratic former U.S. Representative Gabby Giffords, who was critically wounded by a gunman in 2012, said, "Democratic societies will always have political disagreements, but we must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence."
          Numerous other Democratic leaders urged for calm and condemned Kirk's murder. 
          "Political violence is NEVER acceptable," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said. 
          Gavin Newsom called the attack on Kirk "disgusting, vile and reprehensible," and urged Americans to "reject political violence in EVERY form."
          One exception was Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, who blamed Trump, saying, "It's gotta stop ... I think there are people who are fomenting it in this country. I think the president's rhetoric often foments it."
          The shooting came amid conservatives, including Trump, spotlighting the August 22 killing of a Ukrainian refugee in North Carolina, claiming it was a product of liberal criminal-justice policies.
          Kirk said on Fox News the "narrative" advanced by liberals "in the past 10 years (is) that there is a relentless assault against Black people on behalf of white people."
          Kirk said that was not true. "White individuals are more likely to be attacked, especially per capita, by black individuals in this country."
          On social media, angry MAGA pointed to posts that appeared to celebrate Kirk's death as evidence of conservatives increasingly being targeted.
          Fueled by years of rhetoric, amplified by social media echo chambers, this anger reflected a broader narrative in which Trump's allies often portray themselves as besieged patriots facing a lawless and hostile opposition.
          Stewart Rhodes, the pardoned founder of the Oath Keepers militia who was sentenced to 18 years for his role in the January 6 Capitol riot, urged Trump to declare martial law and mobilize veterans as militia leaders during an appearance on Alex Jones' show.
          Chaya Raichik, known for he Libs of TikTok account, posted screenshots of social media users who celebrated Kirk's death. 
          Ryan Nichols, a January 6 rioter pardoned by Trump, urged followers to identify and harass those individuals, saying "Tag them, their employers, and make it so uncomfortable for them to even leave their house ... This is the way!"

          By the end of the day of the shooting, authorities still had no suspect in custody, with the lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper's nest on campus, remaining "at large."
          State police issued a statement on the night of the shooting saying that two men had been detained and one was interrogated by law enforcement, but both were subsequently released.
          FBI director Kash Patel, in incompetent fashion, <a href="https://archive.ph/LWigN" target="_blank">tweeted</a> "The subject for the horrific shooting today that took the life of Charlie Kirk is now in custody. Thank you to the local and state authorities in Utah" before <a href="https://archive.ph/81l3v" target="_blank">tweeting</a> again hours later "The subject in custody has been released after an interrogation by law enforcement.  Our investigation continues and we will continue to release information in interest of transparency."
          On September 11, the FBI said the shooter jumped off the roof and fled into an adjoining neighborhood and that investigators found a "high-powered, bolt-action" rifle in a nearby wooded area.
          Later in the day, the FBI released photos and a video of a person of interest in the shooting and offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the killer's arrest.
          Utah Governor Spencer Cox appealed to the public for help, saying "We cannot do our job without the public's help right now," and that investigators had received over 7,000 tips from the public and had conducted over 200 interviews.

          On September 12, Governor Spencer Cox said a young man, Tyler Robinson, 22, had been taken into custody, capping the 33-hour manhunt.
          A break in the case came when a relative and a family friend alerted the local sheriff's office that he had confessed to them.
          Robinson had confessed to a family friend - or "implied that he had committed" the murder to that friend - and that person in turn contacted the Washington County sheriff's office on September 11.
          Robinson was a third-year student in the electrical apprenticeship program at Dixie Technical College and was taken into custody at his parents' house, about 260 miles southwest of the crime scene.
          Robinson briefly attended Utah State University in Logan for one semester in fall 2021 before dropping out.
          A family member said Robinson had become more political recently and and had once discussed with another family member their dislike for Kirk and his viewpoints.
          Robinson's father recognized him from images released by authorities and encouraged him to turn himself in. 
          He refused at first, but then changed his mind after Robinson's father reached out for help to a youth pastor, who helped Robinson turn himself in.
          Investigators spoke to Robinson's roommate, who showed them comments Robinson had made on Discord discussing retrieving a rifle from a drop point and then dropping it in a bush wrapped in a towel, matching the description of the gun recovered after the shooting in a wooded area near campus.
          Robinson seemingly had a bright future ahead of him, having scored in the top percentile on his college entrance exam and earned himself a four-year scholarship to Utah State University in Logan. 
          His proud mother posted a video on Facebook in which her first-born son, the oldest of three, read aloud the school's letter offering him the grant.
          He was a registered voter but was not affiliated with a political party and was listed as an "inactive" voter due to not participating in the 2024 election.
          Canaan Timothy, 21, said he was in the year below Robinson at high school and that he was just a regular student with an interest in music, who hung out with members of the school band.
          "I knew him in passing. Just your average kid," said Timothy, "Tyler, he was quiet, but not too quiet."
          The Robinsons are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormon church), but a neighbor described them as inactive members.
          Ammunition found at the scene had been inscribed with what appeared to be anti-fascist messages, including: "Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao" (anti-fascist Italian song); "If you read this, you are gay, LMAO"; and "Hey fascist, catch!" followed by an up arrow, right arrow, and three down arrow symbols (originally claimed to be "trans" arrows by Steven Crowder but later found to reference a sequence of controller moves that unleashes bombs in the popular video game Helldivers 2).
          The casing found at the shooting said "Notices bulges OwO what's this?" (furry gooner meme).
          On September 14, Cox said that Robinson was not cooberating with authorities but investigators have been interviewing his friends and family to determine a motive. 
          One person who is apparently talking to investigators is Robinson's roommate, who was also a romantic partner, Cox said, describing them as "a male transitioning to female," and that they had been "incredibly cooperative."
          On September 15, Kash Patel said Robinson's DNA had been found at the scene and they discovered a physical note that was destroyed that he had left saying he had the "opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk" and would do so.
          WaPo also reported Robinson had sent a Discord message shortly after the shooting saying "It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this."

          On September 12, in her first public comments since her spouse was slain, Erika Kirk vowed in a tearful but defiant video message that "the movement built by my husband will not die" but grow stronger.
          Speaking from the studio of his radio-podcast show, she urged young people to join Turning Point, exalting her husband as a fallen political hero who "now and for all eternity will stand at his savior's side wearing the glorious crown of a martyr."
          On September 18, Erika Kirk was named CEO of Turning Point USA.

          Following the shooting many conservatives online said politically motivated attacks were a left-wing phenomenon.
          However, according to a 2022 Maryland START study, of the 1563 individuals who committed violent or non-violent political attacks in the US from 1948-2018, 17.6% were Islamic, 23.4% were left-wing, and 59% were right-wing.
          They also found that for violent terrorists attacks, 55% were Islamic, 35% were right-wing, and 23% were left-wing.
          According to the ADL, in 2023, white supremacists were tied to the overwhelming majority (88%) of extremist-related murders.
          The two deadliest incidents in 2023 were extremist-related shooting sprees by white supremacists: the Allen, Texas, mall shooting in May, and the store shooting in Jacksonville, Florida, in August.

          In the days following the killing, many on the online left took to social media to criticise Kirk's legacy and even cheer on his death.
          This resulted in the U.S. military taking swift disciplinary action against U.S. troops over social media posts linked to Kirk, carrying out a "zero-tolerance" policy toward those it sees as cheering his death, with those being disciplined likely in the dozens according to officials.
          After years of complaints from the right about "cancel culture" from the left, some conservatives began seeking to upend the lives and careers of those who disparaged Kirk after his death. 
          This birthed a campaign by public officials and others on the right to begin calling for the firing or punishment of teachers, an Office Depot employee, government workers, a TV pundit.
          Trump's State Department in the minutes after Kirk's death warned it would revoke the visas of any foreigners who celebrated Kirk's assassination.
          Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn called on social media for the firings of an assistant dean at Middle Tennessee State University and professors at Austin Peay State University and Cumberland University.
          This resulted in all three losing their jobs for their comments, that included expressing pleasure for Kirk's death, with one saying Kirk "spoke his fate into existence."
          Some NFL teams chose on Sunday to hold a moment of silence for Kirk, with the teams that didn't participate being called out by the right.
          On September 17, ABC cancelled late-night host and frequent Trump critic Jimmy Kimmel's show after he suggested on his show "We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it."
          Kimmel's comments led to a response from FCC Chair Brendan Carr, who urged local broadcasters to stop airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live" on ABC and suggested the commission could open an investigation and that broadcasters could potentially be fined or lose their licenses if there was a pattern of distorted comment.
          The nation's largest local television station group, Nexstar Media and Sinclair Broadcast Group, which owns many of ABC's local TV affiliates, said they would stop airing the show following Kimmel's monologue. 
          Sinclair said Kimmel's show would be suspended until he apologizes to the Kirk family. 
          Nexstar and Sinclair both have merger deals pending before the FCC (Nexstar's $6.2 billion merger with Tegna).
          Trump celebrated the suspension of the Jimmy Kimmel Show and said TV broadcasters should lose their licenses over negative coverage of his administration, saying "They're getting a license, I would think maybe their license should be taken away. It will be up to Brendan Carr."
          However, on September 22, six days after his suspension, Disney said that the Kimmel show would be returning the next day.
          The U-turn came after several prominent conservatives, including U.S. Senator Ted Cruz joined Democrats in criticizing the head of the FCC for threatening retaliation against ABC and a mounting campaign against Disney of consumers cancelling Disney+.
          However, both Nextstar and Sinclair later said they would still boycott his show.
          Trump responded on Truth Social that he "can't believe" ABC gave Kimmel back his show, and hinted at further action against the network.
          On September 26, both Nextstar and Sinclair both reversed their decision and said they would air the Kimmel show again.

          On September 16, Robinson made his first court appearance via video link from the county jail, where prosecutors vowed to seek the death penalty and <a href="https://atty.utahcounty.gov/cms/uploads/TJR_Information_49872215e3.pdf" target="_blank">revealed</a> new details of their case, including text messages in which he was alleged to have privately confessed to the fatal shooting and said "I had enough of his hatred."
          The death penalty in Utah requires 12 out of 12 jurors to agree to it in the penalty phase of a trial inorder for it to be imposed.
          Robinson was charged with seven criminal counts including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice for disposing of evidence and witness tampering for asking his roommate to delete incriminating texts.
          The prosecutor said Robinson was charged with aggravated murder because he put others at great risk of death, targeted Kirk for his political expression and knew children would witness the homicide.
          Robinson was ordered to remain held without bond in the Washington County Jail.
          Prosecutors said shortly after the shooting Robinson sent a text message telling his roommate and romantic partner to "drop what you're doing, look under my keyboard," where they found a physical note from Robinson that read: "I had the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I'm going to take it."
          The roommate then asked Robinson in a text reply, "you weren't the one who did it right????" Robinson responded: "I am, I'm sorry."
          Then the roommate asked why he had shot Kirk, Robinson wrote back: "I had enough of his hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out." 
          He also asserted he had planned the attack for more than a week.
          Police had also executed a search warrant on Robinson's residence, where they discovered a shell casing with etchings like the etchings found on the shells in the abandoned rifle.

          On September 17, in the wake of the Kirk assassination, Trump designated the "antifa" movement as a terrorist organization.
          It was not clear what legal weight Trump's proclamation carried, considering antifa is a loosely organized ideological movement without a clear leadership structure or hierarchy.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-targets-antifa-movement-terrorist-organization-2025-09-18/" target="_blank">[25]</a></sup>
          On September 21, a memorial for Charlie Kirk was held in Arizona, with tens of thousands of people attending.
          During the memorial, Trump hailed Kirk as a "martyr for American freedom" and again accused what he called the "radical left" for Kirk's murder, saying "The violence comes largely from the left."
          The memorial featured speeches from other White House officials and had the feel of a religious revival mixed with a "Make America Great Again" rally, especially from Trump's speech, which included attacking Biden and reviving claims the 2020 election was stolen.
          Kirk's wife, Erika, delivered an emotional tribute to her late husband, looking up at the heavens and mouthing, "I love you," before speaking about his devotion to Christianity, his family and his activism. 
          "I want all of you to know, while Charlie died far too early, he was also ready to die," she said. "He left this world without regrets. He did 100% of what he could every day."
          She also offered forgiveness to the 22-year-old man who has been charged with Kirk's murder, citing the Bible's account that Jesus Christ urged his followers to forgive his tormentors while on the cross.
          "My husband Charlie wanted to save young men, just like the one who took his life," she said, before adding tearfully, as the crowd applauded solemnly.
          This was in sharp contrast to Trump, who said of Kirk, "He did not hate his opponents ... That's where I disagreed with Charlie. I hate my opponents."

        <li><u>Pennsylvania Police Ambush</u>
          On September 17, five police officers were shot, three of them fatally, in Pennsylvania while attempting to serve an arrest warrant.
          The suspect, Matthew Ruth, 24, had opened fire on the officers with his AR-15 rifle and was himself killed in the ensuing gunfight.
          Ruth's warrant was for suspicion of stalking, prowling and trespassing.

        <li><u>Texas ICE Shootings</u>
          On September 24, 2025, there was a shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas, Texas.
          The shooter used a sniper from a nearby building and shot three ICE detainees, killing two, before killing himself.
          DHS said the suspect fired "indiscriminately" at the ICE facility, including at a van in the building's secured entryway where the victims were shot.
          The FBI later said they found bullets at the scene that read "ANTI-ICE"
          Trump was quick to accuse "Radical Left Democrats" of stoking anti-ICE violence by "constantly demonizing Law Enforcement, calling for ICE to be demolished, and comparing ICE Officers to Nazis."
          Noem later confirmed the suspected shooter was identified as Joshua Jahn
          Investigators later found a note left by Jahn that he acted alone (not part of a "leftist network"), and intended to kill and "terrorize" ICE agents, whose work he viewed as "human trafficking." 
          The FBI also said Jahn used ICE-tracking apps and downloaded a list of local DHS facilities in preparation for the attack, as well as researching the shooting of Charlie Kirk only a few weeks earlier.
          Other Texas ICE shootings include a police officer was shot in July at an ICE detention center in Prairieland, and a Michigan man was shot dead by agents after opening fire on a U.S. Border Patrol station in McAllen in July.

          The suspect was identified as, Thomas Jacob Sanford, an ex-Marine and Iraq war veteran.
          Trump responded saying that the shooting "appears to be yet another targeted attack on Christians."
          "My heart is breaking for the Grand Blanc community," Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said.

      <h3>Tariffs</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><u>Mexico</u>:
          On August 1, Trump granted Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30% on many goods to allow time to negotiate a broader trade pact.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-hits-dozens-more-countries-with-steep-tariffs-2025-07-31/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>Canada</u>
          On June 27, 2025, Trump abruptly cut off trade talks with Canada, saying that Canada's newly enacted digital services tax on U.S. technology firms was "a direct and blatant attack on our country." 
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tariff-deals-could-be-wrapped-up-by-labor-day-bessent-says-talks-pick-up-2025-06-27/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>

          On August 1, Trump raisee the rate on Canadian goods subject to fentanyl-related tariffs to 35%, from 25% previously, saying Canada had "failed to cooperate" in curbing illicit narcotics flows into the U.S.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-hits-dozens-more-countries-with-steep-tariffs-2025-07-31/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>China</u>
          On May 12, 2025, the US and China agreed to a temporary truce in their tariff trade war, after days of talks mediated in Switzerland.
          The deal leaves US tariffs on China at 30% and China tariffs on the US at 10% from May 14 to August 12.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/investors-cheer-us-china-tariff-truce-cautious-over-final-deal-2025-05-12/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On June 11, after 2 days of talks in London, the US and China made a trade deal with US having 55% tariffs on China (25% pre-existing, 10% reciprocal, 20% for fentanyl) and China would have 10% tariffs on the US.
          Also in the deal, Beijing agreed to supply magnets and rare earth minerals in exchange for the US allowing Chinese students in its colleges and universities. 
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-china-will-supply-rare-earths-us-allow-students-2025-06-11/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
          On August 12, Trump extended the pause on tariffs on China again for another 90 days until November 4.
          China's Commerce Ministry issued a parallel 90-day pause on extra tariffs.
          China's exports to the U.S. fell an annual 21.7% in July, while shipments to Southeast Asia rose 16.6% over the same period as manufacturers sought to pivot to new markets.
          Separate U.S. data showed the trade deficit with China shrank to its lowest in more than 21 years in June.

        </li>
        <li><u>Brazil</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump slapped a 50% tariff on most Brazilian goods to fight what he has called a "witch hunt" against former President Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from the heavier levies.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-issues-blitz-tariff-announcements-copper-brazil-south-korea-small-value-2025-07-30/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On September 22, Trump also sanctioned the wife of Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes after their Supreme Court ruled to convict Bolsonaro of attempting a coup to stay in power after he lost the 2022 election to current leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-targets-wife-brazilian-supreme-court-justice-with-sanctions-2025-09-22/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>India</u>
          On August 6, 2025, Trump imposed an additional 25% tariffs on goods from India (bringing total tp 50%), saying they directly or indirectly imported Russian oil.
          Trump said the duties would kick in in 21 days, providing a wide window of opportunity for an off ramp.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/view-trump-order-imposes-additional-25-tariff-goods-india-2025-08-06/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          On August 26, the DHS confirmed that the tariffs would go into effect after five rounds of failed talks.
          India's Engineering Exports Promotion Council warned that "With these additional tariffs, the exports could come down by 20% to 30% from September onward."

        </li>
        <li><u>Copper</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump announced 50% tariffs on copper piping, dragging down U.S. copper prices more than 17%.
          The move aids manufacturers, but does little to boost the constrained U.S. copper mining industry, which for years has asked Washington for permitting reform or other steps that could fuel growth.
          The move is essentially a boost for Chile and Peru, two of the world's largest copper miners and major suppliers to the United States.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/trump-issues-blitz-tariff-announcements-copper-brazil-south-korea-small-value-2025-07-30/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
        </li>
        <li><u>Lumber</u>
          On September 29, 2025, Trump announced a 10% tariff on imported timber and lumber and 25% duties on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture.
          In Trump's proclamation, he laid out his argument that timber, lumber and furniture imports are eroding U.S. national security to justify the new duties under Section 232 of the Trade Act of 1974.
          Trump said they would start on October 14 and that tariffs would increase on January 1 to 30% for upholstered wooden products and 50% for kitchen cabinets if no deals were reached.
          In April, after the Commerce Department opened the national security probe into U.S. lumber imports and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced its opposition to any restrictions on imports of timber, lumber and their derivative products, saying there was no national security risk.

        <li><u>September 2025 Tariffs</u>
          On September 26, 2025, Trump announced 100% duties on branded drugs (with exemptions for those manufacturing in the US) and 25% levies on heavy-duty trucks, citing national security.
          Trump also announced a 50% tariff on imported kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture (60% of U.S. furniture imports in 2024 came from Vietnam and China).

        </li>
        <li><u>De minimis exemption</u>
          On July 30, 2025, Trump fully suspended the de minimis exception for all US good imports.
          In Trump's Big Beautiful Bill he repealed the legal basis for the de minimis exemption worldwide starting on July 1, 2027.
          Goods shipped through the postal system will face one of two tariffs: either an "ad valorem duty" equal to the effective tariff rate of the package's country of origin or, for six months, a specific tariff of $80 to $200 depending on the country of origin's tariff rate.
          Between 2015 and 2024, the annual volume of de minimis shipments entering the U.S. increased from 134 million shipments to over 1.36 billion shipments. U.S. Customs processes over 4 million daily de minimis shipments.

        </li>
        <li><u>"Liberation Day"</u>
          On April 2, 2025, Trump imposes "reciprocal" tariffs at a base rate of 10% on 50+ countries and with larger tariffs on many of the countries. 
          In response to the tariffs, automaker Stellantis said it would temporarily lay off U.S. workers and close plants in Canada and Mexico, while General Motors said it would increase U.S. production.
          Howard Lutnick and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro both Trump would not back off, and that the tariff increases were not a negotiation.
          However, Trump later said, "The tariffs give us great power to negotiate."
          The Dow dropped 4% (worst since June 2020), the S&P500 dropped 5%, and the Nasdaq fell 6% (worst since March 2020) due to resurging inflation and recession worries.
          For the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.08%, the Nasdaq declined 10.02%, and the Dow fell 7.86%. The Russell 2000 Small Cap Index dropped 9.70%, confirming a bear market.
          Imports to the United States now face an average duty of 22.5%, up from 2.5% in 2024.
          The tariffs also alienated allies in Asia and undercut US strategic efforts to contain China.
          <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-stokes-trade-war-world-reels-tariff-shock-2025-04-03/" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
          Tariff "calculation": 
          Trump's formula for calculating the tariffs was to take the U.S. goods trade deficit with a country, divide it by that country's exports to the U.S. and turn it into a percentage figure; then cut that figure in half to produce the U.S. "reciprocal" tariff, with a floor of 10%.
          This ended up making the uninhabited volcanic Australian territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic, largely inhabited by penguins, have a 10% tariff.
          This also disproportionately hurt the poorest countries in the world such as Madagascar (47% reciprocal tariff, $500 GDP per capita, $733 million of US exports), Lesotho (50% reciprocal tariff), Cambodia (49% reciprocal tariff).
          These countries are so poor they cannot import any US goods due to them being so expensive (they aren't buying Teslas), so they got punished with the sharpest tariff rates as a result.

          The same day the tariffs were announced, the Senate passed a bill that would terminate new tariffs on Canada.
          4 Republicans, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, joined all Dems in a 51-48 vote, the House is unlikely to pass the bill.
          The bill aimed to terminate the national emergency Trump had delcared to impose the tariffs.

          In mid-July, Lesotho declared a national state of disaster due to the "high rates of youth unemployment and job losses" caused by uncertainty surrounding the tariffs.
          Lesotho's liberation day tariffs were originally 50% and Trump's walkback to 10% didn't prevent the economic fallout from the tariffs.
          Lesotho exported $237 million to the US in 2024, mostly textiles for popular brands such as Levi's and Calvin Klein, making up 1/10th of their GDP and 45% of their total exports.
          Previously, in his March 2025 address to Congress, Trump referred to Lesotho as a country "no one has heard of," which Lesotho's FM Lejone Mpotjoane said was "quite insulting."
          Lesotho is one of the world's poorest countries, with 2 million people and a GDP per capita of $916.

          On July 27, the EU struck another framework deal with the US, where Trump would drop their tariffs from the treatened 30% to 15% (still up from the current 10%).
          The 15% tariff had zero-for-zero tariff exceptions on all aircrafts, aircraft parts, certain chemicals, certain generic drugs, some agriculture products, natural resources, and critical raw minerals.
          The deal included $600 billion in EU investments in the US, $750 billion in US energy, and defense purchases but left out the key question of EU spirits.
          On August 21, in a 3-1/2-page joint statement, the two sides spelled out that 15% U.S. tariffs would apply to most EU imports and listed the commitments made, including the EU's pledge to eliminate tariffs on U.S. industrial goods and to give preferential market access for a wide range of U.S. seafood and agricultural goods.
          The US also said it will take steps to reduce the current 27.5% U.S. tariffs on cars and car parts, a huge burden for European carmakers, once Brussels introduces the legislation needed to enact promised tariff cuts on U.S. goods.

        <li><u>The Problem with Tariffs</u>
            <u>Tariffs during Trump's first term</u> created several thousand jobs in the steel and washing machine industries but these gains were more than offset by losses in manufacturing, where higher import costs led to a decline in employment.
            <sup><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/did-trumps-tariffs-benefit-american-workers-and-national-security/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
            <u>Retaliation</u>: the tariffs cause other countries to retaliate, not buy from the US anymore, dump their US bonds to raise rate on US debt (China has $769 bln and Japan has $1.01 tln)
            <u>Supply chains</u>: products today take a lot of parts, these parts come from all over the world meaning tariffs will drive up the price of manufacuring massively and cause stagflation.
            <u>Reduced military spending</u>: if the tariffs cause a recession that will decrease tax revenue, which will decrease defense spending, which will be worse for manufacturing, which is what the tariffs were meant to be for.
            <u>Recession from uncertainty</u>: uncertainty means no investments, which means no sales and no economic growth, with means recession.
            <u>Recession from lower consumer activity</u>: if consumers think the tariffs with go away in 2029 with a new administration they will wait to spend money, which will cause a recession.
            <u>Lower trade deficits</u>: if the US is not importing as much then other countries will have less US dollars, which means they will buy less treasury bonds, which means the US debt rate will increase (1% increase in intrest rates means +80B in annual US debt payments).
            <u>Mistrust of the US</u>: the tariffs included Taiwan and the EU, which are not countries and shows the lack of a plan of caring that went into crafting tariff policy, if people stop trusting the US then the reserve currency status of the US is at stake.
            <u>Bad Tax</u>: tariffs are regressive taxes that also stifle innovation and efficiency by distorting the market.

        <li><u>Tariff Legality</u>
          Trump justified his "reciprocal" tariffs and his tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which gives the president the power to address "unusual and extraordinary" threats during national emergencies.
          Trump said that trade deficits, declining U.S. manufacturing power, and the cross-border flow of drugs were "unusual and extraordinary" threats that justified a national emergency.
          On May 28, 2025, a three-judge panel on the Court of International Trade issued a on permanent injunction Trump's reciprocal tariffs ruling that the constitution gives Congress exclusive authority to regulate commerce with other countries that is not overridden by the president's emergency powers to safeguard the U.S. economy. 
          The ruling blocked all Trump tariffs that used the IEEPA.
          However, they let the tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum remain in place.

          The ruling only affected Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs and his tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico but didn't impact tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
          In their ruling the court wrote, "It seems unlikely that Congress intended, in enacting IEEPA, to depart from its past practice and grant the President unlimited authority to impose tariffs."

          After Trump imposed his secondary tariff deadline on Moscow Medvedev accused him of playing a "game of ultimatums" and moving a step closer to war between Russia and the U.S.
          Trump retorted: "Tell Medvedev, the failed former President of Russia, who thinks he's still President, to watch his words. He's entering very dangerous territory!"
          On July 31, Medvedev waded in again saying Trump's "nervous reaction" showed Russia was on the right course and referring again to Moscow's nuclear capabilities.
          This prompted Trump to deliver a statement the following day on posting U.S. nuclear submarines in "the appropriate regions."

          Polish F-16 fighter jets, Dutch F-35s, Italian AWACS surveillance planes, and NATO mid-air refuelling aircraft scrambled in an operation.
          Moscow denied responsibility for the incident, with a senior diplomat in Poland saying the drones had come from the direction of Ukraine.
          Trump, before meeting with Polish President Karol Nawrocki, a conservative nationalist, said "What's with Russia violating Poland's airspace with drones? Here we go!"
          Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk called the incident a "large-scale provocation" and said he had activated Article 4 of NATO's treaty, under which alliance members can demand consultations with their allies.
          Analysts and Western officials said Russia was testing the alliance's readiness and resolve.

          On September 20, three Russian military jets violated NATO member Estonia's airspace for 12 minutes in another incursion, before Italian F-35s, currently stationed at a base in Estonia, pushed them out.
          Russia denied its jets violated Estonian airspace, saying they flew over neutral waters of the Baltic Sea.
          While incursions over the Vaindloo Island by Russian aircraft are fairly common, they do not usually last as long as this incident.
          Separately, Poland said two Russian fighter jets violated the safety zone of the Petrobaltic drilling platform in the Baltic Sea.
          When asked about the incident Trump said, "I don't love it. I don't like when that happens ... Could be big trouble. I'll let you know later."
          Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said his country had decided to ask NATO to open consultations under Article 4.

          Israeli officials said the strike was aimed at top Hamas leaders including Khalil al-Hayya, its exiled Gaza chief and top negotiator.
          The attack took place shortly after Hamas' armed wing, the al-Qassam Brigades, claimed responsibility for a shooting that killed six people at a bus stop on the outskirts of Jerusalem the day before.
          The assault dealt a serious blow to efforts to reach a ceasefire, especially since negotiations took place in Qatar.
          Saudi Arabia called the strike a "brutal Israeli aggression" against Qatar's sovereignty.
          Trump said he was "very unhappy about every aspect" of the Israeli strike, saying "I'm not thrilled about it."
          Two U.S. officials said the U.S. military had been notified by Israel shortly before the strike but there was no coordination with or approval from Washington.
          Qatar is a major non-NATO ally of Washington and host to al-Udeid Air Base, the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East; it is also where Hamas has long had its political base.

        <li><u>Genocide</u>
          On September 16, 2025, a United Nations Commission of Inquiry concluded Israel has committed genocide in Gaza and that officials including Netanyahu, former defence minister Yoav Gallant, and Israeli President Isaac Herzog incited these acts.
          The U.N. report cites examples of the scale of the killings, aid blockages, forced displacement and the destruction of a fertility clinic to back up its genocide finding.
          Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Daniel Meron, called the report "scandalous" and "fake", saying it had been authored by "Hamas proxies".
          The commission's 72-page legal analysis is the strongest U.N. finding to date but the body is independent and does not officially speak for the United Nations.
          The 1948 U.N. Genocide Convention defines genocide as crimes committed "with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, as such".
          To count as genocide, at least one of five acts must have occurred, the commission found that Israel had committed four of them: killing; causing serious bodily or mental harm; deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the destruction of the Palestinians in whole or in part; and imposing measures intended to prevent births.

        <li><u>Gaza City Assault</u>:
          On September 16, 2025, Israel launched a long-threatened ground assault on Gaza City, declaring "Gaza is burning" as Palestinians there described the most intense bombardment they had faced since the start of the war.
          Israel says that up to 3,000 Hamas fighters are still in the city and that they estimated 40% of people in Gaza City had left. 
          Trump sided with Israel, telling reporters Hamas would have "hell to pay" if it used hostages as human shields during the assault.
          Alternatively, the EU said it would impose new sanctions on Israel, including suspending certain trade provisions.
          Chief of Staff Eyal Zamir, at a meeting Netanyahu convened with security chiefs prior to the assault, urged the prime minister to pursue a ceasefire deal, expressing concern that the Gaza City assault could endanger remaining hostages held by Hamas or be a "death trap" for troops.

          Netanyahu immediately accepted the plan and Trump said Hamas had 2-4 days to agree to it.
          Hamas faced considerable pressure to accept the plan, with the foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Egypt all welcoming the initiative.

          On June 24, an initial assessment from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said that the US strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program a few months and did not destroy it.

          In the days before, Trump sent seven U.S. warships, along with one nuclear-powered fast attack submarine to the Caribbean carrying more than 4,500 sailors and Marines.
          The U.S. military had identified the crew as members of Tren de Aragua, without providing evidence, which the U.S. designated a terrorist group in February.
          Venezuela's Communications Minister, Freddy Nanez, suggested that a video shared by Trump of the strike was created with artificial intelligence (the video wasn't AI).
          Experts questioned whether the decision to summarily kill people merely on suspicion of smuggling drugs violated international law, since trafficking illegal substances is not normally considered a capital offence.
          A week after the strike, the Trump admin still had not released any info on the people they executed or briefed lawmakers on the operation.

          He also said Brussels had shut down social media over hateful content, and criticized Germany for what he described as raids against its own citizens for posting anti-feminist comments, Sweden for convicting a Christian activist, and United Kingdom for backsliding on religious rights.
          He specifically targeted the December cancellation of Romania's elections, which were annulled by the country's top court after accusations of Russian meddling, dismissing worries of disinformation as "ugly Soviet-era words".

          On August 4, 2025, rubio sent a State Department cable which instructed US diplomats in Europe to launch a lobbying campaign to build opposition to the EU's Digital Service Act (DSA), which Washington says restricted free speech.
          The EU's DSA is a landmark law meant to make the online environment safer and fairer by compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.
          The order to US diplomats marks an acceleration of the Trump admin's efforts to promote what it calls "America's free speech tradition".
          Rubio's directive takes particular aim at the DSA's description of illegal content, saying it was expansive, and told U.S. diplomats to advocate to get the definition of "illegal content" narrowed so that it would not curb freedom of expression, including in political and religious discourse.
          Another suggestion was to withdraw or amend the DSA'a Code of Conduct on Disinformation, which the State Department said was setting "overly broad controls" on content in a way that was undermining freedom of expression.
          Other talking points included removing or reducing fines for non-compliance to content restrictions, and not relying on "trusted flaggers", entities designated by national authorities to report illegal online content to platforms.

          Both countries agreed in late July to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia. 
          Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had pressed for the pact, but there was little headway until Trump intervened saying that he warned the Thai and Cambodian leaders that the U.S. would not move forward with trade agreements if the hostilities continued. 
          Both countries faced economic difficulties and neither had reached tariff deals with the U.S., so they were forced into a ceasefire.

          On August 8, 2025, Azerbaijan and Armenia signed a U.S.-brokered peace agreement in a significant accomplishment for the Trump admin in a region seen in Russia's sphere of influence.
          Armenia and Azerbaijan have been at odds since the late 1980s when Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous Azerbaijani region mostly populated by ethnic Armenians, broke away from Azerbaijan with support from Armenia. 
          Azerbaijan took back full control of the region in 2023, prompting almost all of the territory's 100,000 ethnic Armenians to flee to Armenia.
          Trump said the two countries had committed to stop fighting, open up diplomatic relations and respect each other's territorial integrity.
          The agreement includes exclusive U.S. development rights to a strategic transit corridor through the South Caucasus that the White House said would facilitate greater exports of energy and other resources.
          Trump said the United States signed separate deals with each country to expand cooperation on energy, trade and technology.
          He said restrictions had also been lifted on defense cooperation between Azerbaijan and the United States, a development that could also worry Moscow.
          Both leaders praised Trump for helping to end the conflict and said they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.
          Brett Erickson, a sanctions expert and adviser to Loyola University's Chicago School of Law, said "The Caucasus has been a blind spot in sanctions policy," and "A formal peace creates a platform for the West to engage Armenia and Azerbaijan ... to shut down the evasion pipelines."

                      However, in June 2021, the organization approved an interim policy allowing college athletes to make money by selling their name, image and likeness (NIL) rights.
                      The policy allowed student athletes to make money through activities such as signing autographs, endorsing products or businesses, and making personal appearances.
                      In March 2025, the NCAA agreed to permanently eliminate its rule that prohibited student athletes from negotiating NIL deals before enrolling in a school.
                      The change came a day after a legal settlement between the NCAA and a group of state attorneys general who had sued the organization, arguing that the restriction violated federal antitrust law.
                      Experts say the problem is that the NCAA and athletic conferences that govern top sports "have stubbornly refused to grant employment status and collective bargaining to athletes."

                    The Presidential Fitness Test began in 1966 but was phased out under Obama.
                    In the test, children have to run and perform situps, pullups or pushups and a sit-and-reach test, but in 2012 it evolved into the Youth Fitness Program, which the Obama admin said "moved away from recognizing athletic performance to providing a barometer on student's health."
                    Then-first lady Michelle Obama also promoted her "Let's Move" initiative focused on reducing childhood obesity through diet and exercise.

                    Asset managers welcomed the news, saying it was a major step toward modernizing retirement savings.
                    BlackRock, which lobbied the Trump administration to expand asset options, plans to launch its own retirement fund that includes private equity and private credit assets in 2026.
                    The new investment options carry lower disclosure requirements and are generally less easy to sell quickly for cash than the publicly traded stocks and bonds that most retirement funds rely on and they also tend to carry higher fees.
                    Many private equity firms are hungry for the new source of cash that retail investors could offer after three years in which high interest rates shook their time-honored model of buying companies and selling them at a profit.
                    However, private equity firms said the industry may seek litigation reform before it can expand into the market.
                    The Department of Labor issued similar guidance during Trump's first term but few took advantage, fearing litigation.

                      "Reputational risk" is when banks could sanction institutions for activities that are not strictly prohibited but could expose the bank to negative publicity or costly litigation.
                      Banks increasingly complained the reputational risk standard was too subjective and vague, allowing bank supervisors to effectively bar firms from providing services to some people or sectors.

                    Musk has repeatedly complained that environmental impact studies, post-flight mishap investigations and licensing reviews required by the FAA have needlessly slowed testing of SpaceX's Starship rocket.
                    In early 2025, the FAA grounded Starship test flights for nearly two months after back-to-back post-launch explosions rained debris over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to change course.

                    Cashless bail is when defendants are released from jail while awaiting trial based on their promise to appear in court, rather than by paying a specific cash amount.
                    Under the policy, a judge assesses whether a defendant should be released from jail based on their risk of not showing up for trial.
                    Critics say it reduces the incentive for defendants to show up for trial and puts public safety at risk by allowing them back on the street.
                    Supporters say many low-income people can't afford to post bond.
                    A 2024 analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice that looked at 22 cities that enacted bail reform, including cashless bail, and 11 that did not between 2015 and 2021 found no evidence of a link to overall crime trends or specific crimes like violent crime and larceny.
                    Cashless bail is a good idea in theory if paired with strong risk assessments and judicial discretion. 
                    A blanket release policy is bad, but a structured system that detains the truly dangerous while releasing low-risk defendants is more just and still protects public safety.

                    CBO estimated 10 million people on Medicaid will lose coverage due to the bill.
                    The changes include Medicaid eligibility checks twice a year instead of once and 80-hour per month work requirements to receive Medicaid if between ages 19-64.
                    Also replaces the current 6% cap on provider tax revenue (which is collected by states not federally) with a new limit that is indexed to inflation, which indirectly reduces provider taxes.
                    But the bill also sets up a $50 billion rural hospital fund to help rural providers who have argued that the provider tax changes would force them to scale back service.
                    The bill also removes Medicaid eligibility for some non-citizens, including refugees, certain abused spouses and children, and people granted asylum.
                    Also requires states to impose mandatory cost-sharing on expansion enrollees earning more than 100% of the federal poverty level (up from an optional co-pay for above 150% of the poverty level).

                    This includes hiring 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, with $10,000 signing bonuses.
                    Also gives DHS a new $10 billion fund for grants for states that help with federal immigration enforcement and deportation actions.
                    Also provides billions for ship building, munitions systems, and quality of life measures for servicemen and women, as well as $25 billion for the development of the Golden Dome missile defense system.

                    Since 1992, the USDA has spent $9 billion on SNAP-Ed and drew more than 1.8 million people in 2022.
                    Republican lawmakers argued SNAP-Ed was ineffective and redundant, pointing to a 2019 GAO report that found gaps in how the USDA coordinated and assessed its nutrition program.
                    But the USDA addressed many of those concerns in recent years, according to SNAP-Ed officials.

                    This is because it makes Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent and expanded tax breaks for parents and businesses, including for tipped income, overtime pay, seniors and auto loans.
                    Nonpartisan analysts have found that the wealthiest Americans will see the biggest benefits from the bill, while lower-income people would effectively see their incomes drop as the safety-net cuts would outweigh their tax cuts.

        <li><u>Jan 6 Protestors</u> 
          Trump pardoned all but 14 of the 1,590 people involved in the Jan 6 Capitol riots, including those who assaulted police officers, and those with charges from low-level trespassing offenses to seditious conspiracy.
          The 14 rioters not fully pardoned, all members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, had their sentences commuted and were freed from federal prison.
          Trump also ordered the Attorney General to drop all pending cases related to the riot.
          The White House released a proclamation for the pardons, calling the investigation a "grave national injustice" and saying the pardons would begin a "process of national reconciliation."
          Many Trump allies, including Vice President JD Vance, did not expect such broad pardons.
          The decision was criticized by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the largest police union in the US.
          Craig Sicknick, brother of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick (who died after Jan 6), called Trump "pure evil."
          A Reuters poll found that 60% of Americans say Trump should not have pardoned all the rioters.
          Among those released were Stewart Rhodes (Oath Keepers leader, sentenced to 18 years, sentence commuted) and Enrique Tarrio (Proud Boys leader, sentenced to 22 years, sentence commuted).
          After the pardons, a federal judge briefly imposed restrictions on Rhodes and 7 other Oath Keepers, but dropped them after finding the pardons also released them from court supervision.
