      <li><u>Wrongful Deportations</u>:
        <ul>
          <li><u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u>: 
            In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
            In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
            The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).

            On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-sidelines-doj-lawyer-after-judge-orders-return-man-deported-erroneously-2025-04-06/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            On April 7, ahead of the deadline, Chief Justice Roberts issued a stay on Xinis' order while they considered the case, after an appeals court refused to pause the TRO for Trump. 
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-facing-monday-deadline-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man-el-salvador-2025-04-07/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
            On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
            In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful.

            </sup>
            On April 11, Xinis ordered Trump to give daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia, saying the Trump admin has "done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia." 
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-orders-trump-administration-advise-its-steps-return-wrongly-deported-2025-04-11/" target="_blank">[5]</a></sup>
            In the coming days, the Trump admin said Abrego was "alive and secure" but that SC's order to "facilitate" the return of him meant they should only "remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here."
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-state-department-says-deported-maryland-resident-alive-secure-el-salvador-2025-04-13/" target="_blank">[6]</a></sup>
            On April 14, 2025, Trump met with El Salvador president Bukele, during the visit, Bukele said he would not return Abrego Garcia and Trump said he would not ask for him back, with both justifying saying Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.
            During the meeting, Pam Bondi said that "facilitate" meant they would just provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia to the US, she also claimed Kilmar had been given a deportation order twice, when he had never been given one.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-says-it-is-not-required-help-wrongly-deported-man-return-us-2025-04-14/" target="_blank">[7]</a></sup>
            Bukele said he would not return Kilmar since that would be like smuggling a terrorist to the US.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-meet-with-el-salvadors-president-amid-questions-over-deportations-2025-04-14/" target="_blank">[8]</a></sup>
            On April 15, 2025, Xinis ordered DHS and ICE officials to testify under oath about what they were doing to get Abrego Garcia back.
            In the order Xinis said "To date, what the record shows is that nothing has been done (to get Abrego Garcia back). Nothing." 
            She stopped short of ordering Trump to ask El Salvador outright to return Abrego Garcia but said their refusal to do so was "stunning."
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-consider-trumps-compliance-with-order-over-wrongly-deported-man-2025-04-15/" target="_blank">[9]</a></sup>
            On April 16, 2025, Dem Senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador in an attempt to talk to Abrego Garcia but was denied access by the El Salvador's Vice President Felix Ulloa, who also said they were not releasing Abrego Garcia because the US paying to keep him incarcerated.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-senator-lands-el-salvador-seeking-release-wrongly-deported-salvadoran-man-2025-04-16/" target="_blank">[10]</a></sup>
            In a reversal, on April 17, 2025, Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia at a hotel, confirming he was healthy, Abrego Garcia also said he had been moved from CECOT to a better detention facility 8 days before the meeting.

            </sup>
            Also on April 17, 2025, an appeals court rejected Trumps bid to halt Xinis' TRO and also rejected his bid to prevent Xinis from probing if the Trump admin was in contempt for not returning Kilmar.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/probe-trump-teams-compliance-with-order-deported-man-can-proceed-court-rules-2025-04-17/" target="_blank">[12]</a></sup>
            On April 21, 2025, U.S. House Rep Maxwell Frost of Florida, Robert Garcia of California, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon travelled to El Salvador to try and facilitate Abrego Garcia's return but were denied access to Abrego Garcia by the Salvadorian government.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-congress-members-visit-el-salvador-facilitate-release-deported-man-2025-04-21/" target="_blank">[14]</a></sup>
            On May 26, 2025, US Rep from Maryland, Glenn Ivey, was denied access to CECOT after travelling to El Salvador to meet Abrego Garcia, despite having made a formal request with the Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S. ahead of the visit.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/maryland-congressman-denied-access-see-man-wrongly-deported-el-salvador-2025-05-27/" target="_blank">[15]</a></sup>
            On June 6, 2025, Abrego Garcia was flown back to the US to face criminal charges of transporting illegal immigrants, firearms, and drugs.
            Following the indictment, 15-year veteran of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Nashville, Ben Schrader, resigned in protest.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/abrego-garcia-way-us-face-criminal-charges-abc-news-reports-2025-06-06/" target="_blank">[17]</a></sup>
            On June 22, 2025, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Nashville ordered Abrego be released on bail pending his trial.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/abrego-garcia-ordered-released-pending-trial-migrant-smuggling-charges-2025-06-23/" target="_blank">[18]</a></sup>
            A few days later Holmes ordered the pre-trial release of Abrego (non-bail release) and restricted Trump  from deporting him while the case played out.

        <li><u>Young DOGE Techies</u>: 
            After the creation of DOGE, Musk relied on about a dozen young tech engineers with little government experience to takeover the agency.
            These engineers include Gavin Klinger, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine.  
            Gavin Klinger is a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Major grad from Berkeley in 2020, he was previously a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks, he also has a substack where he wrote an article "the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies"; Klinger was later found to have retweeted post from Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate in the past.  
            Luke Forritor is a former intern at SpaceX, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for rocket fuel parts, he graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a CS major, he was previously part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll.
            Edward Coristine is only a highschool grad having been enrolled at Northeastern University, he previously spent 3 weeks at Musk's Neuralink last summer, he also previously created 3 tech firms in Connecticut that are valued at $2.4 million by Zillow; it was later disclosed that Coristine had been fired from his previous job at Path Network amid a leaking investigation.

            In Feb 2025, one of engineers, Marko Elez, resigned from DOGE after he was linked to a deleted social-media account that advocated racism and eugenics.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/staffer-with-elon-musks-doge-amplified-white-supremacists-online-2025-02-07/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            In Mar 2025, it was revealed that Coristine (also called "bigballs"), had ran a network company called DiamondCDN that provided services to cybercriminal group "EGodly,"
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doge-staffer-big-balls-provided-tech-support-cybercrime-ring-records-show-2025-03-26/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
            In April 2025, it was revealed that Christopher Stanley, a former engineer for X and SpaceX, and became a senior advisor in the Deputy Attorney General's office, had previously ran sites that distributed pirated ebooks, bootleg software and video game cheats.
            After Stanely's past was reported by Reuters, his old sites were scrubbed from the Internet Archive, despite DOGE claiming they are for "radical transparency."

          On June 20, 2025, District Judge Indira Talwani in Boston invalidated an NSF policy from May that limited universities to be reimbursed for "indirect costs" of research to just 15% of direct funding, ruling that it was "arbitrary and capricious."

        <li><u>Autism</u>: 
            RFK Jr has claimed that autism is an "epidemic" and that we know that it is caused by "environmental exposure."
            <sup><a href="https://apnews.com/article/rfk-vaccines-autism-measles-obesity-food-dye-f26089856550e978d28fd25b653d8103" target="_blank">[1]</a></sup>
            The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
            Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
            In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
            No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
            Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
            Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
            Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/why-are-autism-rates-rising-2025-01-14/" target="_blank">[2]</a></sup>
            Despite Kennedy saying they would go after autism, during the first 4 months of 2025, has reduced funding for autism-related research by an estimated $31 million to $116 million from $147 million in the same period in 2024.
            The funding cuts came because they involved diverse populations, studied differences in gender or took place at research universities currently under scrutiny by the Trump Admin. 
            <sup><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/trump-administration-cut-autism-related-research-by-26-so-far-2025-2025-05-16/" target="_blank">[3]</a></sup>
            In June 2025, a review on thimerosal and autism that was due to be presented by anti-vaxxer Lyn Redwood cited a study that didn't exist and had the opposite conclusion of a study posted on the CDC website two days before that found no link between thimerosal and autism.

          The service will operate on the 3 major wireless carriers and cost $47.45 a month, in reference to Trump's 45th and 47th presidencies.
          They also announced a new $499 gold smartphone as part of the plan that would be manufactured in the US.
