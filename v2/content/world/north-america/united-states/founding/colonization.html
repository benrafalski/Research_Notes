            </li>
            <li><u>Great Basin and Great Plains (Lakota Sioux)</u>
                Lack of natural resources led to growth of nomadic lifestyles and the importance of hunting bison.
            </li>
            <li><u>Atlantic coast and Northeast (Iroquois)</u>
                Mix of agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies, established permanent villages.

            <li><u>Columbian Exchange</u>
                Trans-atlantic exchange of people, diseases, food, trade, ideas, etc. between the Western Hemisphere, Africa, and Europe.
                Horses (from Europe) dramatically change Native life.
                Disease such as smallpox (from Europe) led to massive population decline as deadly epidemics spread.
                Maize/corn (from America) fueled population increase in Europe.

        <h3>European Colonization</h3>
        <ul>
          <img src="https://d7d1ba7zk5a9k2.archive.ph/79AJe/d84a5d435200b4e6026f93abe471a8b0534be510.jpg" alt="European Colonization" style="max-width: 70%; height: auto;" />
          <li><u>Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)</u>
            Spain & Portugal agree to divide up the Western Hemisphere.
          </li>
          <li><u>St. Augustine</u>
            Spain was the earliest to colonize North America (St. Augustine, 1565).
          </li>
          <li><u>Encomienda System</u>
            Spanish colonists received land with native people.
            Native slave labor in mining (silver) or agriculture (sugar).
            Spanish sought to convert Native people to Catholicism.
          </li>
          <li><u>Racial Mixing</u>
            Racially mixed populations of European, Native, and African people included
            (1) Mestizo: Indian and European heritage, (2) Mulatto: people of mixed white and black ancestry.
          </li>
          <li><u>Pueblo Revolt (1680)</u>
            Attempts to change Native American beliefs led to resistance and conflict.
            Popé's Rebellion in 1680 leads to the death of hundreds of Spanish colonists and the destruction of Catholic churches in the area (modern day New Mexico).
            "Native strove to maintain their political and cultural autonomy."
          </li>
          <li><u>Debating Spanish Colonization</u>
            Debates occurred over how Native Americans should be treated and how "civilized" they were compared to European standards.
            <ul>
              <li>Juan de Sepülveda (pro-colonization):
                "Just Causes for War Against the Indians" that justified Spanish colonization of the Americas.
              </li>
              <li>Bartolomé de las Casas (anti-colonization):
                published in 1552 "A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies" that criticized Spanish treatment of the indigenous people.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><u>Comparing European Colonization</u>
            Protestant England will soon challenge Spanish colonization of North America.
            Unlike the English colonist, the Spanish, French, and Dutch are going to attempt to exploit new world resources AND form more complex relationships with indigenous people.
            Spain and Portugal formed colonies that used Native American and African slave labor in agriculture and mining.
            France, Holland, Spain will trade, intermarry with natives, while the English do not.

          </li>
          <li><u>Reasons for Colonization</u>
            Mercantilism: colonies exist to enrich the Mother country.
            Includes access to raw materials or to provide gold and silver.
