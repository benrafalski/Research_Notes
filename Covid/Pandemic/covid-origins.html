    <h3>What to think</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Perfectly reasonable to have originally thought (Early 2020) that lab leak was plausable given it originated in Wuhan and there is a lab in Wuhan</li>
        <li>However, since then we have a mountain of evidence for a natural origin with the epicenter of the outbreak originating at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan</li>
        <li>Also, Wuhan has lots of rural area with a large bat population, making a bat-to-animal-to-human slip is more likely</li>
        <li>All the big scientists (Worobey, Andersen, Holmes) all originally thought it was a lab leak at the outbreak but changed their mind when presented with new evidence, that is the scientific process</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lab Leak Theory</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No evidence SARS-CoV-2 exisited in a lab prior to the pandemic

    <h3>RaTG13</h3>
    <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RaTG13 -->
    <ul>
        <li>Shi Zhengli lab had RaTG13 and 8 other SARS related viruses her lab collected from a mine in Mojang.

            </sup>
        </li>
        <li>Shi Zhengli published a Nature paper about RaTG13 but didn't release the genomes of the other 8 viruses, 
            leading many to think she was purposefully hiding them.

            </sup>
        </li>
        <li>According to Michael Worobey, 
            the 8 other SARS related viruses (later be known as RaTG15) were not a smoking gun and not more closely related to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13.

            </sup>
        </li>
        <li>According to Eddie Holmes, 
            there was an unpublished paper in 2018 with some sequences related to RaTG13, 
            these sequences had a arbitrary embargo to release of 4 years, 
            so they were released in July 2022 and none of them resembled SARS-CoV-2, 
            however they were subject to many conspiracies because they were taken down after being released.

    <h2>Zoonosis Theory</h2>
    <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonotic_origins_of_COVID-19 -->
    <h3>Wet Market</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Earliest human cases were in Wuhan
            <sup>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_COVID-19" target="_blank">[1]</a>
            </sup>
        </li>
        <li>Patient Zero is still unknown. Exact animal origin still unknown.

                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_COVID-19" target="_blank">[1]</a>
            </sup>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Epicenter of Early Cases</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>There is a paper that shows a map with all the early cases</li>
        <li>A counter-point is that this is due to bias sampling, i.e. the first few cases where around the wet market so that is the only place that the CCDC looked
            <sup>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/3JdzZGhQAPE?list=PLThhnqXYtedyZcPLU1UInRY1qnz5JoqJa&t=3415" target="_blank">[1]</a>
            </sup>
        </li>
        <li>According to Michael Worobey, a majority of the early cases that were detected where detected by doctors themselves and linked to the wet market before any sampling bias could have taken place</li>
            <sup>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/3JdzZGhQAPE?list=PLThhnqXYtedyZcPLU1UInRY1qnz5JoqJa&t=3498" target="_blank">[1]</a>
            </sup>
        <li>A second counter-point is that SARS-CoV-2 has a lack of mutation and when natural viruses make the leap to human hosts we expect to see a vast amount of mutations,
            thus it had to have been engineered in a lab.
            <sup>
                <a href="https://youtu.be/3JdzZGhQAPE?list=PLThhnqXYtedyZcPLU1UInRY1qnz5JoqJa&t=3415" target="_blank">[1]</a>

        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Two Lineages</h4>
    <ul>
        <!-- there are two big papers about this -- find them -->
        <li>There were two different lineages found (A and B) at the wet market at the time of the outbreak,
            which differ at two different sites across their 30,000 nucleotides,
            suggesting that were two spillovers into humans so there would have needed to be two different lab researchers that both happened to go to the wet market after being infected for the lab leak theory to be true.

        <li>Diffuse proposal: 
            there was some proposal where the NIH asked the WIV to add a furin clevage site to some viruses, 
            this is claimed as a smoking gun,
            although the furin clevage site wasn't the only thing SARS-CoV-2 needed,
            it also needed the RBD which is not found anywhere.

            <ul>
                <li>Andersen (Feb 1-3): Question is - evolution or engineering? My problem is that both really rather plausible.</li>
                <li>Garry (Feb 1-3): I still don't know if nCoV was the results of a deliberate manipulation or not.</li>
                <li>Andersen (Feb 1-3): Bottom line is that we can't prove whether this is natural or escape.</li>
                <li>Rambaut (Feb 1-3): If nothing else - the fact that we are discussing this shows how plausible it is.</li>
                <li>Holmes (Feb 1-3): Bottom line is that the Wuhan virus is beautifully adapted to human transmission but we have no trace of that evolutionary history in nature. Correct?</li>
                <br>
                <li>Rambaut (Feb 17): People are picking up on the fact that we don't rule out animal passaging. (which we don't because it is still plausible)</li>
                <li>Andersen (Feb 17): There is no question this'll be picked up with "top scientists consider this could have come from the lab."...At this stage we unfortunately just can't rule out a potential accidental infection from the lab.</li>
                <li>Garry (Feb 17): No, we can't and should not because that would have precipitated the cries of COVER-UP.</li>
                <br>
                <li>[Paper is submitted to Nature Feb 17 and rejected Feb 20]</li>
                <li>Nature (Feb 20): One of our referees raised concerns (also emphasized to the editors) about whether such a piece would feed or quash the conspiracy theories. But more importantly this reviewer feels, and we agree, that the Perspective would quickly become outdated when more scientific data are published (for example on potential reservoir hosts).</li>
                <li>Holmes (Feb 24-45): See attached....Yunnan bat from 2019....Still different in the RBD but other thing is obvious. Discuss. [The "other thing" is an insertion of four amino acids at the same location as the furin cleavage site in SARS-CoV-2.]</li>
                <li>Garry (Feb 24-45): Holy crap - that's amazing.</li>
                <li>Andersen (Feb 24-45): I think this lends pretty strong support for an animal origin of the 'confusing' features of the virus....None of this disproves accidental lab infection, however, it shows that all the steps can occur in nature....Makes it much more likely the full furin site could have been acquired very early in humans or potentially in an intermediate host.</li>
                <li>Holmes (Feb 24-45): I am now strongly in favor of a natural origin.</li>
                <li>Rambaut (Feb 24-45): OK. To return to the paper - so are we going to: (1) Re-nuance it to explicitly lower our bet on the lab passaging scenario on the basis that both cleavage site insertions and the full RBD exist in nature.</li>
                <li>Garry (Feb 24-45): Paper will get a significant upgrade.</li>
                <li>Andersen (Feb 24-45): I'm still favoring a pre-circulation scenario and I believe the furin site could have been fully formed in humans.</li>
                <br>
                <li>[Paper is published March 17]</li>
                <li>Andersen (April 3): This whole furin site being messed with in T/C has me second-guessing myself....I don't think any of this new knowledge goes against what we said in the paper, but it does make our "definitely not passaging" argument weaker.</li>
                <li>Garry (April 3): Yeah - definitely food for thought.</li>

                <li>Andersen (April 16-18): But here's the issue - I'm still not convinced that no culture was involved....So are we absolutely certain that no culture could have been involved?</li>
                <li>Holmes (April 16-18): Culturing in what? Why would culturing make it more human adapted?....Let's face it, unless there is a whistleblower from the [Wuhan lab] who is going to defect and live in the west under a new identity we are NEVER going to know what happened in that lab. Never.</li>
                <li>Andersen (April 16-18): That's why I'm a little worried about these 'cables' - because is it possible they might have something? I'm putting all of this to typical Trump BS smoke and mirrors (and just plain idiocy), but I'm not quite willing to die on this hill.</li>
                <li>Holmes (April 16-18): To me there is too long a series of implausible events to suggest inadvertent escape via lab passage. [Reasons follow.]</li>
                <br>
                <li>Andersen (April 30): So much bullshit again. I have decided I am going to die on this hill.</li>

            (1) the slack messages don't say that, (2) why would they have said it was a lab leak publicly at the start then?

                <li>SARS-CoV-2 RBD binds to ACE2 and has a furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary</li>
                <li>RBD mutations (strong evidence in favor of natural origin): SARS-CoV-2 RBD has high affinity to ACE2 but this interation has been shown to not be ideal and different from the optimal binding from SARS-CoV-1, thus the RBD for SARS-CoV-2 is most likely the result of natural selection</li>
                <li>Furin clevage site: </li>
                <li>Lab leak: improbable according to the authors because of the RBD mutation and that SARS-CoV-2 could not have been derived from any previous viruses</li>
                <li>Natural selection in animal host before zoonotic transfer: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Many early cases were linked to the Huanan market in Wuhan</li>
                        <li>SARS-CoV viruses come from bats</li>
                        <li>RaTG13 is from a bat and is 96% identical but can be ruled out since it diverges at the RBD</li>
                        <li>Malayan pangolions illegally imported into Guangdong province contain coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2</li>
                        <li>Palgolion coronaviruses are not as closely related genomically to to SARS-CoV-2 as RaTG13, they are nearly identical in the RBD</li>
                        <li>The pangalion RBD similarity is strong evidence of a natural selection origin</li>
                        <li>Is possible that the furin clevage site can arise by natural selection due to mutations</li>
                        <li>Animal host would need high population density to allow for the furin clevage site and the ACE2 RBD to have arisen</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Natural selection in humans after zoonotic transfer: Since RBD was already in pangolions, the virus may have spilt to humans first then developed the furin clevage site during human-to-human transmission</li>
