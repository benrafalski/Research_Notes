    <h1>Economic Systems</h1>
    <h2>Socialism</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Public rather than private ownership of property and natural resources</li>
      <li>Why?: because every product is produced is not produced in isolation. Everyone who produces an item should be entitled to a share of it</li>
      <li>Therefore, society as a whole should own or at least control property if it wants to be truly equal</li>
      <li>Directly opposed to capitalism</li>
      <li>Schisms:
        <ul>
            <li>What property should be publicly owned?</li>
            <li>Should public property be controlled by a central government or local governments?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Economists: Karl Marx, Freidrich Engels, Thomas More, Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon, Robert Owen, François-Marie-Charles Fourier, Étienne Cabet</li>
      <li>Utopian Socialism: earliest form of socialism during 1800s. The early utopian societies said capitalism went against human nature and people should live in harmonious cooperation. All of these societies ended up failing. </li>
      <li>Marxism: 
        <ul>
            <li>"scientific" approach to the "fantastic" utopian socialism.</li>
            <li>Marx said that socialism would rise through the clash of social classes, where the working class would rise to establish a socialist society.</li>
            <li>Said freedon is a matter of overcoming necessity. Necessity compels people to work to survive. Therefore, only those who do not need to do this (the ruling class) are truly free.</li>
            <li>Marx said capitalism was progressive because it industrialized the world but was also exploitive</li>
            <li>This exploitation would cause the working class to become class concious under the pressure of depressions/recessions</li>
            <li>After the working class becomes aware, Marx said they would overthrow the capitalists and establish a dictatorship of hte proletariat</li>
            <li>Dictatorship of the proletariat: a society that is ruled by the working/labor/majority class</li>
            <li>To Marx socialism and communism were the basically same, classless, stateless, moneyless communial societies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Christian socialism: </li>
      <li>Anarcho-Communism: </li>
      <li>Fabianisn: </li>
      <li>Syndicalism: </li>
      <li>Guild socialism: </li>
