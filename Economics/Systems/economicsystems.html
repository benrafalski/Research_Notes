    <h1>Economic Systems</h1>
    <h2>Socialism</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Public rather than private ownership of property and natural resources</li>
      <li>Why?: because every product is produced is not produced in isolation. Everyone who produces an item should be entitled to a share of it</li>
      <li>Therefore, society as a whole should own or at least control property if it wants to be truly equal</li>
      <li>Directly opposed to capitalism</li>
      <li>Schisms:
        <ul>
            <li>What property should be publicly owned?</li>
            <li>Should public property be controlled by a central government or local governments?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Economists: Karl Marx, Freidrich Engels, Thomas More, Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon, Robert Owen, François-Marie-Charles Fourier, Étienne Cabet</li>
      <li>Utopian Socialism: earliest form of socialism during 1800s. The early utopian societies said capitalism went against human nature and people should live in harmonious cooperation. All of these societies ended up failing. </li>
      <li>Marxism: 
        <ul>
            <li>"scientific" approach to the "fantastic" utopian socialism.</li>
            <li>Marx said that socialism would rise through the clash of social classes, where the working class would rise to establish a socialist society.</li>
            <li>Said freedon is a matter of overcoming necessity. Necessity compels people to work to survive. Therefore, only those who do not need to do this (the ruling class) are truly free.</li>
            <li>Marx said capitalism was progressive because it industrialized the world but was also exploitive</li>
            <li>This exploitation would cause the working class to become class concious under the pressure of depressions/recessions</li>
            <li>After the working class becomes aware, Marx said they would overthrow the capitalists and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat</li>
            <li>Dictatorship of the proletariat: a society that is ruled by the working/labor/majority class</li>
            <li>To Marx socialism and communism were the basically same, classless, stateless, moneyless communial societies</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Christian socialism: 
        <ul>
          <li>Those that say that Christianity is incompatible with Capitalism</li>
          <li>Prominent ones wer Sait-Simon, Anglican clergymen Frederick Denison Maurice and Charles Kingsley, and Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy</li>
          <li>The Christian Socialist Movement in Britain affiliates itself with the British Labour Party and several PMs have belonged to it</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Anarcho-Communism: 
        <ul>
          <li>Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin said that religion, capitalism, and the state were forms of oppression that must be smashed if we want people to be free</li>
          <li>Bakunin agreed with Marx on a classless/stateless/communial society and disagreed that the dictatorship of the proletariat was needed as a step toward communism</li>
          <li>Bakunin argued that the dictatorship of the proletariat would be even more oppressive than the bourgeois state</li>
          <li>Later advocated included Russian émigré Peter Kropotkin and Emma Goldman</li>
          <li>Basically, Marx said that there needs to be a socialist state before communism, Bakunin said any state is bad and we should go straight to communism with no state at all</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Fabianisn: 
        <ul>
          <li>Centrist verision of socialism that emerged in Britain from the Fabian Society</li>
          <li>The Fabians favored "gradualism" over revolution in bringing about socialism</li>
          <li>Their verision of socialism entailed social control of property through an impartially administered state (a government of enlightened experts)</li>
          <li>Mostly made up of middle-class intellectuals that thought gradual persuasion and education were more likely to lead to socialism as opposed to violent class warfare</li>
          <li>Thus, they aimed at gaining influence in the existing system/parties and exercised considerable influence in the British Labour Party</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Syndicalism: 
        <ul>
          <li>Wanted a decentralized socialism like anarcho-communists</li>
          <li>Emerged from hte French trade-union movement (syndicat means trade union in French)</li>
          <li>In early 1900s it was popular in Spain and Italy before being crushed by the fascists</li>
          <li>Appeared in 1905 in the US with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a labor organization representing 43 groups that was opposed to capitalism</li>
          <li>Syndicalists believe in workers' control and "direct action"</li>
          <li>"Direct action" is the syndicalists means of bring about the overthrow of capitalism and equates general strikes, especially ones that would bring down the government due to the economy halting</li>
          <li>Syndicalists are against the state and policical parties since they don't think they can achieve radical change</li>
          <li>Syndicalists believe that capitalism should be replaced by a state with a loose federation of local workers' groups</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Guild socialism: 
        <ul>
          <li>English movement during the early 1900s</li>
          <li>Medieval guild: association of craftsmen or merchants who determined their own working conditions and activities</li>
          <li>Advocated for public ownership of industries and for their organization into a guild</li>
          <li>Disagreements on the role of the state including if they should just be a coordinator for guilds or if they should just be there for protection and policing</li>
          <li>They were less inclined to give power to the state that Fabians</li>
        </ul>
