    <h2>Socialism</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Public rather than private ownership of property and natural resources</li>
      <li>Why?: because every product is produced is not produced in isolation. Everyone who produces an item should be entitled to a share of it</li>
      <li>Therefore, society as a whole should own or at least control property if it wants to be truly equal</li>
      <li>Directly opposed to capitalism</li>
      <li>Schisms:
        <ul>
            <li>What property should be publicly owned?</li>
            <li>Should public property be controlled by a central government or local governments?</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Economists: Karl Marx, Freidrich Engels, Thomas More, Claude-Henri de Saint-Simon, Robert Owen, François-Marie-Charles Fourier, Étienne Cabet</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Types</h3>
    <h4>Utopian Socialism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>earliest form of socialism during 1800s.</li>
        <li>The early utopian societies said capitalism went against human nature and people should live in harmonious cooperation. All of these societies ended up failing.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Marxism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>"scientific" approach to the "fantastic" utopian socialism.</li>
        <li>Marx said that socialism would rise through the clash of social classes, where the working class would rise to establish a socialist society.</li>
        <li>Said freedon is a matter of overcoming necessity. Necessity compels people to work to survive. Therefore, only those who do not need to do this (the ruling class) are truly free.</li>
        <li>Marx said capitalism was progressive because it industrialized the world but was also exploitive</li>
        <li>This exploitation would cause the working class to become class concious under the pressure of depressions/recessions</li>
        <li>After the working class becomes aware, Marx said they would overthrow the capitalists and establish a dictatorship of the proletariat</li>
        <li>Dictatorship of the proletariat: a society that is ruled by the working/labor/majority class</li>
        <li>To Marx socialism and communism were the basically same, classless, stateless, moneyless communial societies</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Christian Socialism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Those that say that Christianity is incompatible with Capitalism</li>
        <li>Prominent ones wer Sait-Simon, Anglican clergymen Frederick Denison Maurice and Charles Kingsley, and Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy</li>
        <li>The Christian Socialist Movement in Britain affiliates itself with the British Labour Party and several PMs have belonged to it</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Anarcho-Communism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Russian anarchist Mikhail Bakunin said that religion, capitalism, and the state were forms of oppression that must be smashed if we want people to be free</li>
        <li>Bakunin agreed with Marx on a classless/stateless/communial society and disagreed that the dictatorship of the proletariat was needed as a step toward communism</li>
        <li>Bakunin argued that the dictatorship of the proletariat would be even more oppressive than the bourgeois state</li>
        <li>Later advocated included Russian émigré Peter Kropotkin and Emma Goldman</li>
        <li>Basically, Marx said that there needs to be a socialist state before communism, Bakunin said any state is bad and we should go straight to communism with no state at all</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Fabianism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Centrist verision of socialism that emerged in Britain from the Fabian Society</li>
        <li>The Fabians favored "gradualism" over revolution in bringing about socialism</li>
        <li>Their verision of socialism entailed social control of property through an impartially administered state (a government of enlightened experts)</li>
        <li>Mostly made up of middle-class intellectuals that thought gradual persuasion and education were more likely to lead to socialism as opposed to violent class warfare</li>
        <li>Thus, they aimed at gaining influence in the existing system/parties and exercised considerable influence in the British Labour Party</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Syndicalism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Wanted a decentralized socialism like anarcho-communists</li>
        <li>Emerged from the French trade-union movement (syndicat means trade union in French)</li>
        <li>In early 1900s it was popular in Spain and Italy before being crushed by the fascists</li>
        <li>Appeared in 1905 in the US with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a labor organization representing 43 groups that was opposed to capitalism</li>
        <li>Syndicalists believe in workers' control and "direct action"</li>
        <li>"Direct action" is the syndicalists means of bring about the overthrow of capitalism and equates general strikes, especially ones that would bring down the government due to the economy halting</li>
        <li>Syndicalists are against the state and policical parties since they don't think they can achieve radical change</li>
        <li>Syndicalists believe that capitalism should be replaced by a state with a loose federation of local workers' groups</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Guild socialism</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>English movement during the early 1900s</li>
        <li>Medieval guild: association of craftsmen or merchants who determined their own working conditions and activities</li>
        <li>Advocated for public ownership of industries and for their organization into a guild</li>
        <li>Disagreements on the role of the state including if they should just be a coordinator for guilds or if they should just be there for protection and policing</li>
        <li>They were less inclined to give power to the state that Fabians</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>History of Socialism</h3>
    <h4>Revisionism and Revolution</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1883, Marx died</li>
        <li>Social Democratic Party of Germany: political party in Germany that was Marxist and had gained considerable (1/5 of the vote) influence in Germany by 1890</li>
        <li>With the rise of the SPD, the socialists began to revise the Marx doctrine of revolution in favor of electoral politics</li>
        <li>Revisionism idea of a gradual transformation over a revolution that was initially controversial and rejected by the SPD but later triumphed over revolutionary Marxism</li>
        <li>Eduard Bernstein: theorized revisionism by questioning aspects of Marx's theory including:
            <ul>
                <li>rejecting the labor theory of value, economic determinism, and the significance of class struggle</li>
                <li>argued against Marx's predictions: that capitalism was not on the verge of collapse, capital was not being amassed by fewer and fewer people, that the middle class was not shrinking, and that the working class was not afflicted by "increasing misery"</li>
                <li>argued that conditions were improving for the proletariat largely as a result of trade-unions and increased suffrage in representative government</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Lenin</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Lenin: was a remaining orthodox Marxism following the SPD transformation to revisionism</li>
        <li>Bolsheviks: led by Lenin, was the majority faction of the Russian Social-Democratic Workers' Party</li>
        <li>Problem for Russian was that they were still semifeudal in the 1890s and most Marxists believed that you need to go capitalism first before you could become communist, Lenin believed that feudalism to socialism was possible</li>
        <li>Capitalism is needed before communism because (1) there wouldn't be the productive power, (2) there wouldn't be any revolutionary proletariat, (3) there wouldn't be any capitalist expolitation to be free from</li>
        <li>Vanguard party: Lenin argued that the proletariat would not lead a revolution if they were left as they were because they would only fight for better wages/working conditions and thus, needed to be educated, enlightened, and led to revolution by a vanguard party of professional revolutionaries</li>
        <li>Lenin argued that the vanguard party needed to be conspiratorial, disciplined, and elitist in order to work within the authoritarian Russian government of the time</li>
        <li>Mensheviks: disputed Lenin's vangard party theory and believed that liberal capitalism needed to come before socialism but was labeled the minority faction after Lenin proclamed his side as the Bolsheviks</li>
        <li>Imperialism: Lenin argued that the conditions of the proletariat were improving because the capitalist were bribing them with their "superprofits" that the capitalist were extracting from imperialism in poorer parts of the world</li>
        <li>Lenin argued that imperialism was the last stage of capitalism and lead to socialist revolutions in both the industrialized countries as well as the ones that had not gone through capitalism yet</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h4>Revolution</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1914, WWI broke out and the European socialist were all forced to choose between international socialism and their countries, which they chose their contries, Luxemburg was the only country to stick with socialism with Russia</li>
        <li>1917 Russian Revolution: WWI created severe hardships for the Russian people and contributed to the collapse of the tsarist regime under which the Bolsheviks siezed power in a revolution in 1917</li>
        <li>All-Russian Communist Party: new party name for the Bolsheviks after the revolution</li>
        <li>Comintern: Communist International/Third International that Lenin tried to convene with all the other socialist in Europe after WWI</li>
        <li>Comintern failed though because it became apparent that it was just an agent of the newly formed USSR in 1922 (instead of international socialism) and due to the communist Spartacus Revolt in Germany being crushed in March 1919</li>
        <li>By the formation of the USSR there was a clear split between the communists and the socialists (social democrats)</li>
    </ul>
