        <p>Located in southwestern Asia. Territory included Golan Heights that is occupied by Israel since the 1967 six day war. The capital is Damascus. They gained independence in 1946. Ever since then, life has been marked by social, religious, and political unrest. In 1970, authoritarian ruler Pres. Hafez al-Assad came to power and focused on military power to take back the territory they lost to Israel in 1967. In 2000, Hafaez died and Bashar al-Assad took over. He would continue his father's authoritarian style of rule leading to the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The authoritarian regime under Assad was a cult of personality around him and gained popularity due to their polices of economic development, land reform, promotion of education, strengthening of the military, and vehement opposition to Israel.</li>
                        <li>As president, Hafez brought stability to Syria and established it as a major power in the Middle East</li>
                        <li>Assad reverted the radical socialist policies of the Jadid regime and strengthened privatization in the economy after taking over in 1971, despite the 1973 consitution only allowing for public, collective and individual property</li>
                        <li>Assads foreign policy consisted of strengthening relations with the Soviets to develop the Syrian economy/military, normalizing relations with Egypt/Saudi Arabia to establish a "Cairo-Damascus-Riyadh axis" against Israel</li>
                        <li>Due to this and harsh repression of anti-Baathist opponents, the Assad government saw large stability in Syria with the alliance of the Baath Party, the military, and the bureaucracy (which was led by Assad and supported by and Alawite network of officials and officers)</li>
                        <li>The majority Sunni population outside of Damascus and in merchant groups were the main opponents of the Baathist-Alawite government</li>
                        <li>Hafez's foreign policy was marked by wars with Israel during the 1960s-70s, a rivalry with Baathists Iraq, and intervention in Lebanon.</li>
                        <li>Arab nationalism flourished under Assad, emphasizing the Palestinain problem, socialism, and anti-imperialism and was brought to the cities and sponsored in media (movies, TV, radio) by the Baath government</li>
                        <li>In the 1980s, Syria's economy began to stagnate and saw inflation and government corruption due to a weak private sector and military spending, especially in Lebanon</li>
                        <li>Assad turned to the oil rich states in the Middle East for aid and turned to China for military supplies after the USSR fell in 1991.</li>

                            <li>Assad appealed to the Aflaqites directly and recruited them to build his power over the larger Jadid faction in the Baathist government</li>
                            <li>After Syria failed in their intervention in the Black September crisis in Jordan, Assad began planning to overthrow Jadid</li>

                            <li>On November 12, the National Congress was broken up and Assad had Jadid and his associated arrested</li>

                            <li>Later in 1971, Assad shifted to viewing the Aflaqites in the government as a threat to his power and conducted a showtrial on Michel Aflaq and former Syrian President Amin al-Hafiz</li>
                            <li>Both Aflaq and Hafiz were sentenced to death and Assad also purged 99 other party members by imprisoning them</li>
                            <li>This purge completely wiped the Aflaq influence from the Syrian Baath party</li>
                            <li>The constitution only allowed for Sunnis to become president so Assad faked being a Sunni by praying in Sunni mosques even though he was Alawite to gain the support of the ulama</li>
                            <li>He also appointed many Sunnis to high ranking positions in the Baathist government</li>
                            <li>In March 1971, Assad was sworn in as president</li>
                            <li>Assad had consolidated his power over Syria and Alawites began to occupy coveted positions in all Syrian sectors</li>

                            <li>The 1973 constitution reinforced the the leading role of the Baathist Party in Syria and transformed the revolutionary state into a Presidential Monarchy in which all power was consalidated under the Syrian President (Assad) in a one-party (Baathist) socialist state</li>
                            <li>Under the new consitution, the President served for 7-year terms with no term limits and was nominated by the Baath Party and approved by parliament</li>
                            <li>The consitution not requiring the President to be Muslim resulted in riots in Hama, Homs, and Aleppo organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and the ulama</li>
                            <li>In March 1973, Assad folded to the pressure and returned the Muslim President requirement then obtained a fatwa from a Lebanese cleric proclaiming that Alawites were a part of Shia Islam</li>
                            <li>The consitution also emphasized pan-Arab ideology and positioned Syria as one region in the wider Arab nation and calls out the need to protect against imperialism and Zionism</li>
                            <li>This gave Assad full control over the military, party, and bureaucracy</li>
                            <li>Assad further strengthened his power by assigning Alawite loyalists to high ranking positions in various state institutions</li>

                            <li>In 1967 during the six day war, Israel captured half of the Golan Heights from Syria</li>
                            <li>Following the six day war, the Arab states would hold the position that were would be no peace, no recognition, and no negotiations with Israel</li>
                            <li>The Yom Kippur War was from October 6-25, 1973, led by a coalition of Arab states (Egypt, Syria, Jordan) headed by Syria and Egypt against Israel</li>
                            <li>In the weeks before the war, Syrian troops were detected on the border and Israel sent reinforcements to the Golan Heights</li>
                            <li>Initially, Israel was going to attack Syria preemtively but decided against it (in fear of losing US support) and then the war officially began when Egypt and Syria suprise attacked Israel (on Yom Kippur, CIA even failed to predict the attack) by invading the Sinai and the Golan Heights (which were captured in the 1967 war)</li>
                            <li>During the war, Egypt unexpectedly ceased hostilities exposing the Syrian front, this made Assad resent Anwar Sadat until his death.</li>
                            <li>The IDF initially sustained heavy loses against the Syrian forces and lost the southern Golan Heights on October 8 (Israel even considered using nukes in fear of total defeat, until the US resupplied them on Oct 14), but by Oct 10 Israel had recaptured the Golan territory and pushed the Syrians back across the Purple Line (pre-war ceasefire line)</li>
                            <li>On Oct. 11, Israel chose to push deeper into Syria and reached within 30km of Damascus but were eventually halted by Iraqi and Jordanian counterattacks from within Syria on October 12-21</li>
                            <li>The Egyptians and Syrians were both being funnelled arms by the Soviets (starting Oct 9 and some Soviet personnel even fought alongside the Syrians) and Israel by the US (starting Oct 14)</li>
                            <li>An initial UN ceasefire was brokered on October 22 (resolution 338) but fighting continued with Israel pushing to the outskirts of Cairo</li>
                            <li>This forced a second ceasefire on October 25  that ended the war due to the dangerously heightened tensions between the US and the Soviets</li>
                            <li>In December 1973 there was a peace summit in Geneva between Israel and the Arab states mediated by the Soviets and the US but the confrence ended when Syria refused attendance</li>
                            <li>Syrian and Israeli forces continued to fight in an attrition war into 1974 until a final disengagement agreement was agreed upon due to Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy in May 1974 (official end of the Yom Kippur War)</li>
                            <li>Under the agreement, Israel gave back mount Hermon and the Quneitra to Syria and pulled back to the Purple Line, however Israel now controlled more territory than after 1967.</li>
                            <li>A UN buffer zone was established by the UN Disengagement and Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights and the agreement has remained in place until today</li>

                            <li>In April 1975, the Lebanese Civil War broke out between Lebanese Christian militias and Palestinian insurgents, mainly the PLO</li>
                            <li>In January 1976, Assad brokered a truce between the two sides but covertly sent Syrian PLA (Pal Liberation Army) troops into Lebanon inorder to bring the PLO back under Syrian influence</li>
                            <li>Despite the truce, hostilities continued and the Christian President of Lebanon requested Syria to formally intervene in the war</li>
                            <li>In June 1976, Syria sent 12,000 regular Syrian troops to fight against leftist Pal militias due to their connections to Sunni Islamists and the Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>In August 1976, the Lebanese Christian Maronite forces, supported by Syria, attacked the Pal militias at the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp, killing 1000-1500 civilians, which unleashed heavy critisism on Syria from the Arab world</li>
                            <li>In October 1976, Syria accepted an Arab League proposal that gave Syria a mandate to keep 40,000 troops in Lebanon as part of an Arab Deterrent Force to bring the war to an end and restore calm</li>
                            <li>In 1977, the Syrian forces in the ADF took part in the 100 days war subconflict of the civil war in Beirut</li>
                            <li>From December 1980-June 1981, the Battle of Zehleh took place between the Lebanese forces (aided by the Christian townspeople) and the Syrian ADF (aided by the PLO)</li>
                            <li>The battle broke out when the Syrians closed all roads in and out of Zahleh (imposing a siege) fearing that Israel would collude with the Lebanese forces and attack Syrian territiry (Zahleh is close to the Bekka Valley along the Syrian-Lebanese border), causing the LF to attack in fear of a Syrian invasion on Zahleh</li>
                            <li>In 1982, the Syrian's primary mission shifted to protecting the Beirut-Damascus highway (outside the Bekka Valley) since it was their main supply line to Lebanon</li>
                            <li>On June 8, 1982, IDF and Syrian forces began to fight each other in the Battle of Jezzine</li>
                            <li>By June 11, the IDF had pushed the PLO and Syrian forces to Beirut and a ceasefire between the groups was established on June 12</li>
                            <li>On June 13, the ceasefire fell apart and fighting continued until around June 22</li>
                            <li>In October 1990, Syria launched a major operation with their Lebanese allies into Beirut and took the capital forcing the Christian leader Aoun to flee to Paris</li>

                            <li>This included the Muslim Brotherhood, who had been part of the Syrian parliament before the coup and disagreed with the Baathist ultra-secular foundation, wanting Syria to be an Islamic Republic</li>
                            <li>This culminated in the Hama uprising in 1964 led by Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>In the aftermath of the Hama revolt being crushed the Fighting Vanguard was formed</li>
                            <li>The Fighting Vanguard was led by Marwan Hadid and was a spliter group of the Brotherhood due to the Brotherhood's rejection of Hadid's calls for jihad against the Baathists</li>
                            <li>In March 1973, Assad's new consitution added further to the Muslim anger after it didn't require the President to be Muslim</li>
                            <li>After the October war in 1973, Syria also fell into an economic downturn</li>
                            <li>In June 1976, Hadid was captured and died in prison and the remaining members of the Vanguard vowed to avenge his dead</li>
                            <li>Later in 1976, the Vanguard would carry out terror attacks, including explosions and assassinations aimed at prominent military/government officers/bureaucrats, most of which were Alawite</li>
                            <li>This resulted in a series of indiscriminate jihadist attacks on the minority Alawite community</li>
                            <li>Throughout the uprising, the insurgents would be supported with arms and supplies by the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein</li>
                            <li>Jisr ash-Shughur massacre: in March 1980 a bunch of Jisr ash-Shughur residents marched on the Baath headquarters and set it on fire, the military responded by arresting 200 people then executing almost all of them</li>
                            <li>The insugency concluded in 1982 following the Hama massacre when the Brotherhood was defeated</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>After the initial breakout of the Islamic uprising, the terror attacks continued into 1979</li>
                            <li>In June 1979, at the Aleppo artillery school, all the school cadets were called to an urgent meeting in the dining hall where they (83 Alawite cadets) were massacred by gunmen with automatic weapons and grenades</li>
                            <li>The massacre was planned by Adnan Uqla, a Vanguard commander, who committed the massacre without permission of the Vanguard's leader, Hisham Jumbaz</li>
                            <li>In August 1976, the Brotherhood effectively claimed responsibility when they declared jihad on the Syrian government, although they never outright claimed responsibility</li>
                            <li>The Aleppo school massacre is important because it was a turning point in the Islamic insurgency from a series of sporadic attacks to a full-scale urban warfare between the Assad government and the Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>Starting in November 1979, the Brotherhood terror attacks on Baath party officials/targets became almost a daily occurence (mostly in Aleppo and other northern cities)</li>
                            <li>By April 1980, the Baath government responded to the increase in violence with a brutal police/military crackdown</li>
                            <li>Between 1979-1981 the Aleppo crackdowns resulted in ~2000 deaths (many civilians indiscriminatly) and 8000 arrests; Brotherhood attacks resulted in 300 Baath/Alawite deaths</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>On June 27, 1980, Hafez ordered a deadly crackdown on the Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>On the same day, this resulted in the Tadmor Prison massacre where Rifaat al-Assad's (Hafez's brother) brigade killed ~1000 Tadmur prisoners in an act of revenge against the Islamist prisoners</li>

                            <li>In April 1981, Islamic guerillas staged a failed attack on an Alawite village near Hama</li>
                            <li>In revenge, the Baath government responded by deploying military units (led again by Rifaat al-Assad) in Hama who killed between 150-350 people, chosen randomly among the male population over 14</li>
                            <li>This would become known as the 1981 Hama massacre and was the bloodiest revenge act so far in the al-Assad Islamic uprising crackdown</li>
                            <li>In February 1982, the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and Fighting Vangurard led another uprising in Hama, calling for jihad against the Baaths and quickly took control of the city</li>
                            <li>Hafez sent Rifaat's forces into the city and called for a surrender then besieged the city for 27 days</li>
                            <li>The Baath military forces attacked indiscriminately and razed much of the city</li>
                            <li>Casualties: estimated between 5,000-30,000 civilians dead, massacre is considered the "single deadliest act" of violence perpetrated by a state upon its own population in modern Arab history</li>
                            <li>The 1982 Hama massacre marked the end of the Islamic uprising as the Brotherhood would operate in exile following it (mainly in Iran)</li>
                            <li>Assad would also continue to rely on repression rather than political tactics for the remainder of his rule.</li>

                            <li>In 1976, Israel began supporting Lebanese Christians in South Lebanon against the PLO</li>
                            <li>Israel supported the Christian Maronite Phalange party led by Bashir Gemayel, who's strategy was to provoke Israel by provoking Syria into retalitory attacks on Christians</li>
                            <li>In June 1982, Israel invaded southern Lebanon, attacking the PLO following an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to the UK by an Iraq-backed group Abu Nidal (who were actually enemies with the PLO)</li>
                            <li>At the time, Begin was the PM of Israel and publicly stated they didn't want any confrontation with Syria, only to drive out the PLO</li>
                            <li>However, the driving force behind the Israeli invasion was Ariel Sharon and one of his many reasons for invading included driving out the Syrian Army from Lebanon, who backed the PLO and who had over 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon at the time.</li>
                            <li>Thus, the Syrian and IDF clash was inevitable and planned from the start by Sharon</li>
                            <li>One IDF division was sent to the Bekaa Valley, to (and succeeded) prevent Syrian reinforcements and prevent Syrian forces from being able to intervene in the Israeli invasion.</li>
                            <li>On June 8, 1982, the IDF and Syrian army battled in the Battle of Jezzine in central Lebanon, with the IDF winning that same day.</li>
                            <li>After the battle, Assad was convinced that the IDF wanted to fight the Syrians too, not just the PLO as they had publicly stated and sped up the deployment of Syrian forces in the Bekaa Valley</li>
                            <li>Israel saw that the Syrians were only brining forces from the Golan Heights as a sign that Syria didn't want a wider was and decided to launch an operation on Syria the next day</li>
                            <li>On June 9, 1982, Israel launched Operation Mole Cricket 19 on the Syria forces, which was one of the largest air battles since WW2 and was the first time in history that a western-equipped air force destroyed a Soviet SAM (surface to air missile) network, resulted in a dramatic victory for Israel.</li>
                            <li>On June 10, Reagan imposed on Begin and Assad to agree to a ceasefire but it fell apart.</li>
                            <li>Israeli advances deeper into Lebanon would continue to defeat the PLO and Syrian forces until June 11 there was an Israeli-Syrian ceasefire that was extended to the PLO on June 12 but it fell apart on June 13.</li>
                            <li>On June 15, Israel cut the Beirut-Damascus highway, cutting off any Syrian reinforcements and offered Syrian forces in Beirut to withdraw to the Bekaa Valley but the Syrian government refused and fighting along the highway continued from June 16-22.</li>
                            <li>On June 22, Israel launched an operation to fully capture the highway and by June 25, they had forced the Syrians to withdraw and a ceasefire was announced.</li>
                            <li>During the war, the IAF saw great success and dominated the Syrians, while tank battles were more evenly matched</li>
                            <li>In September 1982, Bachir Gemayel, the newly elected president of Lebanon and former Christian Phalangists commander, was assassinated in a bombing by a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (who supported "Greater Syria")</li>
                            <li>In May 1983 Lebanon and Israel agreed on an Israeli withdraw from Lebanon under the condition that Syrian troops leave but under Syrian pressure Lebanon backed out in March 1984</li>
                            <li>In January 1985, Israel began a phased withdraw from Lebanon back to a security zone in south Lebanon, they would occupy south Lebanon for the next 20 years</li>
                            <li>After the Israelis withdrew to the security zone was finished in June 1985, the Syrians gained de facto occupation of North Lebanon and Assad began to slowly re-grow his limited control over Lebanon</li>

                            <li>At the start of the 1982 Lebanon war, Assad had expelled Arafat and the Pal factions allied to Syria in Lebanon</li>
                            <li>Starting in May 1983, Syria backed the anti-Arafat PLO forces of Abu Musa in the Bekka Valley</li>    
                            <li>Assad wanted to control both the PLO and Lebanon as a whole because he was worried if Palestinians got too out of control Israel would invade again</li>
                            <li>Assad feared an Israeli invasion would cause a mass flight of Pals from Lebanon, which was a problem because they were mostly Sunni and he was Alawite</li>
                            <li>Initially, the Syrians supported Pal groups such as as-Saiqa, PFLP-GC (Syrian PFLP), and the pro-Syrian Fatah splinter Abu Musa</li>
                            <li>However, the Syrian backed groups were only strong in Syrian controlled territories, in the other part of Lebanon, Fatah, the PFLP, and the DFLP all has stronger support</li>
                            <li>In June 1983, Arafat harshly critisized the Syrian government for blocking PLO supplies and Assad responded by declaring Arafat as an person that is unacceptable to work with</li>
                            <li>In November 1983, Musa led the Fatah Infifada against the Arafat Fatah faction anf forced Arafat to flee to Tunisia by December</li>
                            <li>However, over the next two years, Arafat would quietly return to Lebanon and root himself in refugee camps in Beirut and south Lebanon</li>
                            <li>The return of Arafat drove Assad's fears of an Israeli invasion again so he formed a alliance with the Shia Amal Movement (Lebanon Resistance Regimes) militia</li>
                            <li>Pal groups in Lebanon that refused to side with the Syrians against Arafat were met with Syrian wrath, such as the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (OCAL), who was driven underground after 1987</li>
                            <li>In May 1985, the war of the camps broke out between the various pro-Arafat militias in Lebanon against anti-Arafat militias including the Abu Musa, As-Saiqa, the PLA, and the PFLP-GC and pro-Syrian militias backed by Syria including the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) and the Amal Movement.</li>
                            <li>The war of the camps was basically fighting between the Palestinian camp militias all over Lebanon</li>
                            <li>By the end of May 1985, the Arab League and the Soviets pressured Syria into a meeting for the issue in June and the next day Amal declared a unilateral ceasefire, however low scale fighting continued</li>
                            <li>In December 1985, the Syrians and their Lebanese allies agreed to stabilize the situation in Lebanon, this was opposed by the Phalangists</li>
                            <li>In September 1986, the fighting continued and didn't end until April 1987, after Syrian commando troops were forced in intervene again and took over positions around the camps and Beirut after being pressured by Iran</li>

                    <h2 class="title">Syrian Occupation of Lebanon</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>The occupation began in May 1976, when Syria intervened in the Lebanese Civil War; Syria sent 2,000 troops into Lebanon and the occupation was eventually legitimized by the Arab League, who allowed the Arab Deterrent Force in Lebanon as a peacekeeping force (primarily composed of Syrian troops)</li>
                            <li>During the occupation, Assad spread the idea of "Greater Syria" and took steps to integrate Lebanon into Syria</li>
                            <li>Hafez quote July 1976: "Syria and Lebanon were one state and one people... and have shared interests and a common history"</li>
                            <li>Hafez quote 1983: "Lebanon and Syria are one single people, one single nation. We may be divided into two independent states, but that does not mean that we are two different nations... I would even argue that the feeling of kinship between Syria and Lebanon runs deeper than it does between states in the United States... Soviet Union is not in Lebanon and never was present there, neither before nor after the Israeli invasion."</li>
                            <li>In 1989, the Lebanese Civil War ended and Beirut was split between the rival parties</li>
                            <li>East Beirut was controlled by Michel Aoun (anti-Syrian and military government) and West Beirut was controlled by Selim el-Hoss (supported by Syria and civilian government)</li>
                            <li>In March 1989, the "War of Liberation" was started by Aoun to rid Lebanon of the Syrians but was defeated and exiled in October 1990 after losing international support (much of Aoun's support was from Iraq, who sent aid from 1988 until Iraq was invaded in 1990)</li>
                            <li>In October 1989, the Lebanese Civil war ended with the signing of the the Syrian-sponsored Taif Agreement, which provided for a large role for Syria in Lebanese affairs including foreign policy and economic matters.</li>
                            <li>After the war ended, about 1 million Syrians went to Lebanon to find jobs and in 1994, the Lebanese government controversially granted citizenship to over 200,000 Syrians</li>
                            <li>In 1991, this paved the way for Lebanon and Syria to sign the treaty of "Brotherhood, Cooperation, and Coordination," legitimizing Syrian military presence and giving them responsibility to defend Lebanon</li>
                            <li>In October 1991, Syria launched a major operation both army and airforce, into Lebanon against Aoun in his stronghold of the presidential palace, killing hundreds of Aoun supporters and forcing Aoun into exile in Paris</li>
                            <li>The Syrian operation was only able to take place after the US convinced Israel not to interfere with Syrian forces in Beirut, in exchange for Syria helping in the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein.</li>
                            <li>The Syrian occupation of Lebanon was a proxy war between all the militias in Lebanon who were being backed by Iran (Hezbollah), the US (Syria, Israel), and the Soviets (National Movement).</li>
                            <li>Hafez was the only Arab leader to occupy another Arab country for 30 years and subjegated not only oppressed the Syrians but also the Lebanese, by trying to force a common thought and culture onto them through heavy governmental influence and pressure</li>
                            <li>The Syrian occupation was particularly disadventageous to the Maronite population, since most of their leadership was either killed, jailed, or exiled. </li>

                            <li>In January 1991, a 42 country US-led coalition began Operaion Desert Storm (aerial bombing campaign) against Iraq after Saddam invaded neighboring Kuwait in August 1990</li>
                            <li>Assad condemned the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait</li>
                            <li>In September 1990, James Baker traveled to Syria to meet with Assad</li>
                            <li>Assad personnally hated Saddam for the fact that "Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years."</li>
                            <li>After the Baker visit, Assad pledged to give 100,000 Syrian troops to the US-led coalition</li>
                            <li>This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition</li>
                            <li>In exchange, the US gave Assad the green light to wipe out anti-Syrian forces in Lebanon and arranged for $1 billion in weapons to go to Syria through other Gulf states</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In 1967 the Golan Heights came under Israeli occupation and the Israelis began settling there until in 1981, they unilaterally annexed their part of the Golan Heights</li>
                            <li>After the US victory in the Gulf War, Bush wanted to use the opportunity to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process in a multi-party international conference</li>
                            <li>At the Madrid Confrence in October 1991, bilateral talks were initiated between Israel and Syria and hosted by Spain with the US and USSR as co-sponsors</li>
                            <li>The negotations were split between bilateral negoations for each country present (Israel-Syria, Israel-Lebanon, Israel-Palestine), and multilateral ones focusing on major issues like water and refugees</li>
                            <li>Syria and Lebanon refused to take part in the multilateral mettings unless there was concrete progress on the bilateral ones.</li>
                            <li>Syria continued to engage in negotiations with Israel throughout the 1990s over the return of the occupied Golan Heights and possible peace accords but each one ended in failure</li>
                            <li>The last direct talks between Syria and Israel was between Hafez and Bill Clinton in March 2000</li>
                            <li>After 2000, the talks ultimately failed because of Assad's insistence on Israel's full withdrawl from the Golan Heights.</li>
                            <li>In 2008, the talks were renewed with Turkey as a mediator but fell apart after Ehud Olmert resigned as PM of Israel</li>
                            <li>Five villages of mostly Druze Arabs were offered Israeli citizenship after 1967</li>
                            <li>In 2010, the Druze became more vocal and Israel witnessed an uptick in citizenship applications while others began holding rallies loyal to Syria.</li>
                            <li>In March 2019, the US was the first country to recognize Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to the instability and history of military coups, during the 1990s the question of who would succeed Hafez was a principal domestic question</li>
                            <li>Originally, Basil al-Assad, Hafez's eldest son, was seen as the expected successor</li>
                            <li>In 1994, Basil died in a car crash and Hafez began grooming Bashar to become the next president</li>
                            <li>In 1998, Hafez's brother, Rifaat al-Assad, was "relieved of his post" as vice president</li>
                            <li>In 2000, Hafez died and Bashar succeeded him in the presidency after winning elections, he was unopposed and won 97% of the vote</li>
                            <li>Immediately after Hafez's death, the Syrian Parliament reduced the minimum age of the President from 40 to 34 to accomidate Bashar</li>
                            <li>Many had high hopes for Bashar, with domestic and international observers expecting him to have a degree of order and continuity, more political openness in Syrian society, and carry out the government reform campaign started under Hafez to root out corruption.</li>
                            <li>However, Bashar would continue to rule with an iron fist with brutal repression of political dissents and a clampdown on civil society movements, banning all public opposition</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Under Hafez, there were 5 security agencies that functioned to suppress political opposition</li>
                            <li>These included: state of emergency put in place in 1963, military courts applying martial law, special courts to try political cases, prisoners were often tortured and held in despicable conditions</li>
                            <li>However, in 1998, the level of repression diminished noticeably</li>
                            <li>After Hafez's death, in June 2000, a period of intense political and social debate started in Syria</li>
                            <li>Assad also released 600 political prisoners early in his term and improved relations with Iraq</li>
                            <li>However, the expected liberalization of Syria never came, with only economic-related measures ever being implemented and even those were slow to progress</li>
                            <li>Damascus spring began with Statement 99 by 99 Syrian intellectuals on September 2000 calling for the state of emergency to be ended, all political prisoners to be pardoned, deportees and exiles to he allowed to return, freedom of speech/assembly, and freedom from the government.</li>
                            <li>The movement consisted of various forums where groups of like minded people in oppoistion to the Baath regime met privately to discuss political matters.</li>
                            <li>In November 2000, the government responded by releasing hundreds of political prisoners and the closure of the Mezze prison</li>
                            <li>However, the Damascus Spring would come to an end in 2001, when the government returned to repression with a number of imprisonments and forced closure of forums</li>
                            <li>In May 2001, Pope John Paul II visited Damascus</li>
                            <li>In October 2005, a group of Syrian opposition figures issued the Damascus Declaration calling Assad and the government "authoritarian, totalitarian, and cliquish"</li>
                            <li>They called for a "peaceful, gradual" reform and was signed by Arab, Kurdish, and even Muslim Brotherhood figures</li>
                            <li>In 2007, amid an oppostion boycott, Assad won a second election term in office</li>
                            <li>Critics denounced the elections after Assad ran unopposed and achieved just under 100% of the vote.</li>
                            <li>In October 2008, 12 signatores of the Damascus Declaration were sentenced to 2.5 years in prison</li>

                    <h2 class="title">Syrian Withdraw from Lebanon</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 2000, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon and Hafez died, resulting in a strong resistance to Syrian presence from the Lebanese population</li>
                            <li>In August 2001, the first anti-Syrian demonstrations in Lebanon began and turned violent, resulting in the Lebanese-Syrian security system brutally repressing the revolt, with arrests of hundreds of people (mainly Christians) without justification.</li>
                            <li>In September 2004, UNSC resolution 1559 was adopted (coauthored by US/France) calling for free elections in Lebanon, the disarming of militias like Hezbollah, and all foreign forces (Syria) to withdraw and cease intervening in Lebanese politics.</li>

                            <li>In February 2005, Lebanese PM Rafic Hariri (anti-Syrian), was assassinated in a truck bomb attack.</li>
                            <li>The Lebanese government accused 6 Austrialian nationals of carrying out the attack but they were later absolved.</li>
                            <li>Despite non-substantial evidence for any party having carried out the attacks, the Lebanese population largely blamed Syria government and the pro-Syrian Lebanese president Emile Lahoud for the assassination.</li>
                            <li>This sparked Cedar Revolution with mass nonvoilent/peaceful protests with the goals of: (1) full Syrian withdraw from Lebanon, (2) independent leadership and parliement elections free from Syrian influence, (3) an independent commission to investigate Hariri's death</li>
                            <li>Most of the international community called for Syria to withdraw and implement UN resolution 1559</li>
                            <li>Hezbollah was against resolution 1559 and led mass pro-Syrian protests with hundreds of thousands of (mostly Shite) protesters.</li>
                            <li>Daily protests says large getherings of over 25,000 people and, unlike the 1990s anti-Syrian demonstrations, were not met with force from the government.</li>
                            <li>On February 28 2005, the pro-Syrian government under PM Omar Karami resigned and called for new elections. </li>
                            
                            <li>In April 2005, all Syrian occupation forces had completed the full withdrawl from Lebanon and implemented resolution 1559, due to the Cedar Revolution</li>
                            <li>Also in April 2005, a general election was held, and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon was created to investigate Hariri's death; achieving all the main goals of the revolution</li>
                            <li>In October 2008, Syria and Lebanon established dimplomatic relations and opened embassies for the first time in history.</li>

                    <h2 class="title">Relations with Turkey</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turkey has always been a foe of Iran, Iraq and Syria due to their secular democracy and close relations with the EU/US</li>
                            <li>Syria and Turkey had traditionally had sour relations due to the self-annexation of the Hatay Province (Alexandretta) in 1939, water diputes from dams built on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers during the Southeastern Anatolia Project, and Syrian support for the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK)</li>
                            <li>Syria and Turkey came to the brink of war after Turkey threatened military action if Syrian didn't stop sheltering Abdullah Ocalan in Damascus, which was his long time safe-haven</li>

                            <li>In 1978, Ocalan founded the PKK in Turkey and in 1979, he departed from Turkey for Syria after establishing connections with militant Pal orgs</li>
                            <li>In the early 1980s, the PKK spread further into Iraq and in 1984 launched an armed resistance against Turkey from Iraq that would turn into an all-out war</li>
                            <li>In October 1998, relations with Turkey improved somewhat when the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, was expelled by Syrian authorities</li>



                            <li>In Janurary 2004, Bashar was the first Syrian president to visit Ankara and later in 2004 Erdogan came to Damascus to sign a joint free trade agreement</li>
                            <li>In April 2007, Assad and Erdogan met again at the ceremony of hte Aleppo International Stadium and in 2005 Turkish President Sezer visited Damascus during the Cedar Revolution</li>
                            <li>In 2008, Turkey was invited to mediate talks between Irael and Syria over the Golan Heights, the talks ended up failing</li>
                            <li>In April 2009, Turkey and Syrian had an unprecedented three-day military exercise along their shared border</li>
                            <li>However, after the Syrian Civil War broke out, relations were strained again and diplomatic contact was suspended in March 2012</li>
                            <li>In June 2012, a Turkish military training flight was downed by Syrian forces resulting in Turkey calling an emergency NATO meeting.</li>


                            <li>After the power vacuum was formed during the Syrian Civil War, in 2015, the PKK took large swaths of territory in northeastern Syria</li>
                            <li>In July 2016, a failed coup attempt in Turkey led to government crackdowns, including against the PKK</li>
                            <li>In August 2016, Turkey launched an offensive into northwestern Syria to prevent the PKK from expanding into western Syria or launching cross-border attacks.</li>

                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Leading up to the Arab Spring, Syria was considered the most restrictive police state in the Arab World</li>
                            <li>This included more than 400 travel bans on individuals that were political opponents to Assad, aresting of journalists, and tightening of internet censorship</li>
                            <li>Social discontent was also caused by the US invasion of Iraq, the most intense drought ever recorded in the region, and widespread corruption (nepotism and bribery) within the Baathist government</li>
                            <li>The protesters demanded the end of the state of emergency, more freedoms, and an end to pervasive government corruption</li>
                            <li>In March 2011, as part of the larger Arab Spring, popular discontent within the Baathist government led to large scale pro-democracy/anti-Assad rallies and protests accross Syria</li>
                            <li>The protests originated on March 6 2011 in Daraa following the detainment of 15 young students who were spray painting anti-government graffiti</li>
                            <li>The Daraa protests quickly spread and they eventually burned down the Baath party headquarters and other buildings, with security forces responding by firing live ammunition at crowds</li>
                            <li>By late March 2011, the protests had spread to Damascus, al-Hasakah, Deir az-Zor, Hama, Homs, Aleppo, and Latakia</li>
                            <li>However, the Syrian Revolution protests were violently suppressed by the Assad regime and tens of thousands of deaths and detentions occured following an official "shoot to kill" policy by the government, deploying snipers/heavy machine guns/shelling</li>
                            <li>Assad also imposed a complete media blackout, banning independent news coverage and banning any foreign press</li>
                            <li>Mass defections occured after security forces who disagreed with the government policy against the demonstrations were themselves fired upon by the Baathist paramilitaries and Shabiha death squads (Alawite loyalists executioners)</li>
                            <li>In April 2011, the Baath regime announced concessions such as political reforms and policy changes as well has a lift of the state of emergency (used for arbitrary arrests and political supression), but the protests continued</li>
                            <li>After the failed concessions, in late April 2011 Assad deployed the Syrian Army and Shabiha mercenaries on the protesters using tanks and live ammunition to unleash violence on the civilians, who continued to demonstrate in larger and larger protests</li>
                            <li>In July 2011, the early insurgency phase of the Syrian civil war began with the formation of the FSA</li>
                            <li>From August 2011 to June 2012, anti-government demonstrations continued and were met with repression</li>
                            <li>In June 2012, the revolution had transformed into a full-blown civil war</li>
                            <li>Between 2011 and 2012, more than 60,000 Syrian civilians had been killed by the Syrian military forces</li>

                            <li>After the failed concessions and repressions by Assad in April 2011, the anti-government demonstrations continued and were met with further repression</li>
                            <li>In July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed by 7 defected Syrian Army officers and composed of defected soldiers, marking the beginning of armed insurgency against the Syrian Arab Republic</li>
                            <li>The FSA's stated goal was to bring down the Assad government</li>
                            <li>In August 2011, Syrian opposition factions and dissidents formed an anti-Assad coalition called the Syrian National Council and political branch of the FSA based in Turkey</li>
                            <li>In October 2011, the FSA began recieving active support from the Turkish government</li>
                            <li>Later in October 2011, there were massive pro-Assad rallies with over an estimated million demostrators</li>

                            <li>In April 2012, Assad began deploying attack helicopters against the rebels</li>
                            <li>Later in April 2012, a UN backed ceasefire was declared but quickly failed.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to the Syrian FSA insurgency raging on for over a year, the Arab League and the UN moved to form a peace plan</li>
                            <li>In February 2012, the Arab League and the UN appointed Kofi Annan as their special envoy to Syria</li>
                            <li>In March 2012, Kofi submitted a 6 point peace plan to the UNSC and in late March, it was announced that Assad had accpeted the peace plan</li>
                            <li>In early April, "both parties appeared to be observing the ceasefire" but shelling started again in late April 2012 and by May 2012, both the FSA and the Syrian government were violating the ceasefire</li>
                            <li>On 25 May 2012, the Houla massacre took place, where 108 people were summarily executed, resulting in the FSA ultimatum to the Baath government and calling the ceasefire "dead" as they began mounting a nationwide offensive on the government troops</li>
                            <li>By June 2012, the Kofi peace initiative had fully fallen apart, with both sides openly engaging in violence again</li>
                            <li>Also in June 2012, Assad vowed to crush the anti-government uprisings and shortly after fighting broke out in Latakia</li>
                            <li>On 12 June 2012, the UN for the first time officially proclaimed Syria to be in a state of civil war</li>
                            <li>Later in June 2012, peaceful protests spread to Aleppo and Damascus and then a Turkish fighter jet was shot down by the Syrian government killing both pilots and forcing Assad to apologise.</li>
                            <li>In July 2012, the Syrian Government took parts of Homs, Idlib and Damascus and fighting intensified in Aleppo, where Syrian government forces used fighter jets on the rebels</li>
                            <li>In September 2012, the Syrian Army killed 21 Kurds in Aleppo, causing the Kurdish YPG to retaliate against the Syrian Army</li>
                            <li>Also in September 2012, the FSA siezed a border crossing in Raqqa between Syria and Turkey, who was supporting the rebels</li>
                            <li>In October 2012, the rebel forces took parts of Idlib and the highway linking Damascus to Aleppo</li>
                            <li>In late October 2012, Lakhdar Brahimi (Kofi replacement) arranged a ceasefire that quickly fell apart</li>
                            <li>After the ceasefire fell, the Syrian Army moved on Damascus and the rebels made gains in Idlib, Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor</li>
                            <li>In December 2012, the Syrian Army began using Scud missiles on the rebels but the rebels still made gains in Damascus and Idlib and launched an offensive in Homs</li>
                            <li>In Jan-Feb 2013, the rebels made gains in Idlib, Raqqa, Aleppo, and Al-Hasakah, the Syrian Army also began shelling Hezbollah targets, and the Syrian Army engaged in fighting with the Kurdish YPG</li>
                            <li>In March 2013, the rebels captured Raqqa city, which was first provincial capital to fall and the Syrian Army first started shelling rebel targets in Lebanon</li>
                            <li>From April-June 2013, the Syrian Government forces, with the help of Hezbollah, launched an offensive and retook territory around Damascus, Idlib, Homs, Daara</li>
                            <li>From July-October 2013, fighting continued with increased activity from ISIS and other jihadist groups (FSA formally declared war on ISIS in June 2013) as well as the YPG and other Kurdish groups and with the FSA and Syrian Army trading territories in a stalemate</li>
                            <li>In August 2013, the Syrian Army used a chemical attack near Damascus leading to hundreds of deaths</li>
                            <li>From Oct-Dec 2013, the Syrian Army with allies Hezbollah and the al-Abas brigade, lauched an offensive on Damascus and Aleppo and recaptured territories in both regions</li>
                            <li>In November 2013, the Islamic rebels took the al-Omar oil field (largest in Syria) forcing the government to almost entirely rely on imported oil</li>

                            <li>In 2013, the FSA and ISIL cooperated somewhat with only small clashes but then a full-out conflict began to break out in January 2014 when ISIL forces attacked the rebel held town of Atarib in Aleppo</li>
                            <li>In the first week of fighting, the rebels (Islamic Frons, al-Nusra, Ahrar ash-Sham) made large gains against ISIL in Aleppo, Raqqa, Dier ez-Zor, and Aleppo</li>
                            <li>In the second week, ISIL and Islamic Front signed a truce deal in Al-Hasakah and ISIL captured almost all of Raqqa (against al-Nusra) while ISIL and the rebels were in a stalemate in Aleppo</li>
                            <li>During this time, ISIL used suicide bombing attacks, car bombing attacks, and mass executed prisoners they had taken</li>
                            <li>For the rest of the first month, ISIL continued to take some territory but took multiple loses among seniro commanders</li>
                            <li>In late Jan 2014, ISIL attempted to reach out for an end to inter-rebel fighting, however this fell apart when ISIL attacked al-Nusra in Deir ez-Zor</li>
                            <li>In February 2014, ISIL attacked the al-Tawhid Brigade (Islamist group) in Aleppo, causing al-Qaeda to break links with ISIL and distance themselves from the group</li>

                            <li>By July 2014, ISIL controlled between 95-96% of Deir ez-Zor due to having reinforcements from Iraq and mass rebel defections to ISIL</li>
                            <li>In July 2014, Jaysh al-Islam took East Ghouta in Damascus from ISIL but later 1000 Jaysh al-Sham fighters would defect to ISIL in Raqqa</li>
                            <li>Also in July 2014, rebel groups (SRF, al-Nusra, Sham legion, FSA, others) formed a unit to fight ISIL in Aleppo</li>
                            <li>ISIL made advances in Aleppo until October with continuing defections to ISIL, ISIL beheadings and kidmapping familiies, causing Turkey to announce a buffer zone with Syria and US airstrikes against ISIL to slow their advances</li>

                            <li>From July-October 2015, the Euphrates Volcano (Kurdish rebel alliance) took ISIL territories in Aleppo and al-Hasakah with the help of US airstrikes</li>
                            <li>For all of 2015, most ISIL-rebel fighting took place in Rif Dimashq, with some factions from both sides also fighting with the Syrian Army, Lebanese Army, and Hezbollah along the Lebanese border</li>
                            <li>In March-April 2016, the Al-Tanf and Darra offensives took place against ISIL where the FSA Southern Front backed by the US, the rebels lost in Al-Tanf by won in Daraa</li>

                            <li>By Feb 2017, rebels with Turkish air support, finished the battle of Al-Bab and completely captured it from ISIL</li>
                            <li>During 2017-18, the US was primarily supporting anti-ISIL forces through the Kurdish SDF rather than the FSA</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2017, ISIL launched an offensive in Northwestern Syria (Hama, Idlib, Aleppo), however ISIL failed and was defeated by the rebels</li>

                            <li>In 2014, it was reported that Jund al-Aqsa, a subgroup of al-Nusra, was receiving funding from wealthy Gulf states to not attack ISIL</li>
                            <li>This formed a rift between Jund al-Aqsa and al-Nusra + Ahrar al-Sham</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2015, Jund al-Aqsa left the Army of Conquest, and reaffirmed loyalty to al-Qaeda</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>After the 2011 breakout, Obama sactioned Syria and supported the FSA with covert CIA training (Timber Sycamore)</li>
                            <li>Timber Sycamore was a secret weapons supply and training program launched in 2012/13 by Obama to fight Assad forces (cancelled in 2017 under Trump)</li>
                            <li>It was viewed as ineffective and expensive and resulted in floods of assult rifles, mortars, and rocket launchers on the Middle East black market and raised concerns of US-backed rebels fighting alongside al-Nusra</li>
                            <li>In July 2014, the US carried out a special forces operation against the Osama Bin Laden Camp held by ISIL to rescue hostages, the mission failed and ISIL beheaded three of the journalists in August (James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Briton David Haines)</li>
                            <li>In Sept 2014, the US officially intervened (Congress AUMF approved but not Syrian govt approved) in the civil war (Operation Inherent Resolve), with the goal of eradicating ISIS (and al-Nusra), who controlled eastern Syria in Aug 2014, and to make Assad stop gasing his own citizens</li>
                            <li>The 2014 intervention involved an air campaign with the US successfully forming a coalition including: UK, France, Jordan, Turkey, Canada, Australia, etc (60 total countries)</li>
                            <li>The Sept 2014 intervention was against ISIL but also targeted the Khorasan Group (core of al-Qaeda) in Idlib and al-Nusra in Raqqa</li>
                            <li>Also in Sept 2014, ISIL launched an offensive on Kobani against the Kurds (YPG)</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2014, Turkey (they refused before) and the US began supporting the YPG</li>
                            <li>Later in Oct 2014, the US and Turkey began the covert "Syrian Train and Equip Program" to train oppostion rebel forces (FSA) in Syria and included Jordan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia</li>
                            <li>Train and equip only led to 54 trained fighters by July 2015, who were quickly killed by al-Nusra, Trump ended the program in 2017</li>
                            <li>In Nov 2015, Obama began the deployment of US special forces in Syria to assist the rebels against ISIL</li>
                            <li>In late 2015, the coalition planes were dropping or launching an average of 67 bombs/missiles a day in Syria</li>
                            <li>Throughout 2016, the US ground forces would fight alongside the SDF (YPG and YPJ), Turkey condemned them</li>
                            <li>In March 2017, Trump deployed an additional 400 Marines to Raqqa to fight ISIL, this was seen as an escalation from the previous special forces only deployments</li>
                            <li>In April 2017, the US airstriked Shayrat Airbase, the first Syrian government target</li>
                            <li>In Jan 2018, Trump indicated its intention to maintain open-ended presence in Syria to counter Iran and oust Assad</li>
                            <li>However in Dec 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew 2000-2500 US troops with no clear timetable, in Jan 2019 a suicide bomb killed 4 US troops and dispite large critisism Trump reaffirmed his policy of withdrawl</li>
                            <li>In Feb 2019 he announced 400 troops would stay due to the potential power vacuum, with the phased withdrawl to continue</li>
                            <li>In March 2019, the coalition successfully eradicated ISIS in the battle of Bughuz Fawqani</li>
                            <li>The coalition estimated that they had liberated nearly 110,000 sqkm and 7.7 million people from ISIL control</li>
                            <li>In Jan 2019, Trump and Turkey's Erdogan agrees to set up a buffer zone between Turkey and Syria in Rojave to prevent Turkish-Kurdish (US-backed Kurds that is) clashes</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2019, a US special forces raid in Idlib killed the ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2019, the Turkey-Syria buffer zone collapes ad Trump ordered all US forces withdraw from Rojave and gave his approval for a Turkish incursion against the SDF (who was the US main ally against ISIL)</li>
                            <li>This controversial and seen as the US reneging on their alliance with the SDF in favor of NATO and Turkey</li>
                            <li>However, in Nov 2019, Trump (under pressure from Congress) repositioned US troops in Eastern Syria (al-Hasakah and Deir ez-Zor) with the mission of securing SDF controlled oil/gas infrastructure from the ISIS insurgency</li>
                            <li>In Nov 2019, Trump said any remaining US troops in Syria were there "only for the oil", and that the US was "keeping the oil"</li>

                            <li>In Aug 2020, the UN estimated that 10,000 ISIL militants remained in Syria and Iraq</li>
                            <li>As of Feb 2021, there were around 900 US troops in Syria</li>

                            <li>UK based rights group Airwars, alleges that the US coalition strikes led to over 2000 civilian deaths in Syria during the intervention</li>
                            <li>Polling: in 2014 61% of Americans supported ISIL intervention, in 2016 72% Americans supported ISIL airstrikes, in 2016 58% of Americans supported ISIL special forces, in 2016 26% of Americans supported sending arms or supplies to anti-government rebels in Syria.</li>

                            <li>In March 2015 in the second battle of Idlib, the Army of Conquest (formed earlier that month) assaulted Idlib from 3 sides, capturing multiple cities</li>
                            <li>The Syrian Army Tiger Forces, led by Col. Suheil Al Hassan were sent to attempt to recapture the territory lost by the Syrian Army in the second battle of Idlib</li>
                            <li>The "Battle of Victory" offensive was launched on 22 April 2015 and saw the rebels capture the city of Jisr al-Shughur within days and later on an Army base</li>
                            <li>Two main attack forces were (1) Army of Conquest with 90% coming from Ahrar ash-Sham (Turkey supported Islamic rebel group) and al-Nusra (al-Qaeda affiliate), (2) FSA brigades</li>
                            <li>By April 25, the rebels captured Jisr al-Shughur, during the Syrian Army's retreat from their final holdout in the city hospital they executed 23 prisoners</li>

                            <li>Following, in July 2015, the Syrian Army launched their own offensive to retake Palmyra that narrowly failed</li>
                            <li>In March 2016, another offensive was launched by the Syrian Army with the help of the Russian Air Force which was successful in recapturing Palmyra back from ISIL</li>

                        <ul>
                            <!-- overview -->
                            <li>During the Russian intervention there were numerous spates between the US and Russia, increasing tensions and creating a cold war like atmosphere of military power projection</li>
                            <li>The intervention made Russia a more formitable world superpower and gave it access to the Eastern Mediterranean</li>
                            <li>Due to the dire situation Assad was facing in 2015, Russia cooperated at a high level (with the IRGC) with Iran to achieve keeping Assad's regime in power</li>
                            <li>During Russia's involvement in the Syrian Civil War, it has been generally thought that Russia was responsible for air support while Iran was responsible for ground support, both in conjunction with their respective Syrian Army counterparts</li>
                            <li>In terms of the Syrian Civil War, the Russian intervention was what allowed the Assad govt to retake Syria, stay in power, and shift from defence to offence (turn tide of the war in his favor)</li>
                            <li>Russia used a scortched earch tactics in Syria with reports of them deliberatly targeting hospitals, schools, and civilians homes, being accused of war crimes</li>
                            <li>BMJ Global Health and UN investigation report in 2020 said Russia had "weaponized healthcare" with a deliberate hospital bombardment campaign of bombing ambulances, clinical facilities, and medical infrastructure</li>
                            <li>Russian weapons used include: mix of unguided bombs and precision-guided munitions but mostly unguided with high precision guidance systems, cluster bombs, incendiares (similar to white phosphorus and thermobaric weapons)</li>

                            <li>Putin has tried to assuage the Russian war weariness by undercounting causualty figures, regularly issuing declarations of victory, and twice (2016 and 2017) declaring a "the withdrawal of Russian troops", to avoid another Soviet-Afghanistan situation from the 1980s</li>

                            <!-- alleged war crimes and massacres -->

                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <!-- ISIL background -->
                            <li>Originally from the Jaish al-Ta'ifa al-Mansurah group in 2004 and was aligned with Al-Qauda during Iraq insurgency under the name Islamic State of Iraq until Al-Qaeda cut ties in 2014 due to an unreconcilable conflict between them</li>
                            <li>In the 2014 split, they took large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria due to the Syrian Civil War</li>
                            <li>They changed their name to Islamic State of Iraq and Levant (ISIL) around April 2013 and then to just Islamic State in June 2014, proclaiming itself as a worldwide caliphate despite most Muslim countries (who refer to ISIL as Daesh) and the UN rejecting this assertion</li>
                            <li>By the end of 2015, ISIL controlled a population of 12 million people, ruled under Islamic Sharia Law (enforced with their Al-Hisbah morality police), and commanded over 30,000 militants</li>
                            <li>ISIL has been deemed a terrorist group by the UN, EU, and 32 nations including the US, Russia, and China; and has been condemned and called anti-Islamic by the mainstream Muslim community and Muslim majority countries; even Iran and their Axis of Resistance aim to eradicate ISIL</li>
                            <li>Ideology: Salafi jihadist, a Sunni Ismalic ideology that seeks to implement a global theocratic Islamic caliphate though militant attacks on non-Muslim targets, they also believe women should be "good wives of jihad" and are basically only good for being mothers</li>
                            <li>ISIL doesn't like: Yazidis, Shias, Christians, Hindus, and LGBTs, also antisemetic and misogynistic</li>
                            <li>Recruiting: uses apocalyptic rhetoric propaganda to recruit foreign fighters, they recruit from foreigners all over central Asia</li>
                            <li>Leadership: in June 2014, the group appointed their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as its caliph after saying they traced his lineage back to Muhammad, in Oct 2019 the US conducted a special operation in al-Baghdadi's compound in Idlib resulting in al-Baghdadi killing himself with a suicide vest, after his death ISIL has had multiple different leaders that have all been killed by the US, most of ISIL's officers are made up of former Iraqi military officials from Saddam's government</li>
                            <li>Strategy: their strategy is fear, they want to eliminate the "gray zone" (moderate Muslims in the west) and only have black (non-Muslim) and white (ISIL), they achieve this through spectatular terrorist attacks inside western nations</li>
                            <li>Supplies: ISIL most of their weapons from caputured sources in Syria and Iraq but they also make some of their own weapons, 90% of ISIL's weapons originated in China, Russia, or Eastern Europe, some also originated from US/Saudi weapons supplied to the FSA</li>

                            <!-- Human rights -->

                            <!-- Start of ISIL -->
                            <li>In 1999, ISIL was created in Jordan under the name Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2004, the group swore loyalty to Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda and renamed to Tanẓīm Qā'idat al-Jihād fī Bilād al-Rāfidayn or al-Qaeda in Iraq</li>
                            <li>In Jan 2006, al-Qaeda in Iraq merged with some other terrorist groups into the the Mujahideen Shura Council (MSC)</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2006, the MSC merged with some more Sunni terrorist groups and declared the Islamic State of Iraq in Iraq's 6 mostly Sunni governorates with Abu Omar al-Baghdadi its emir</li>
                            <li>In April 2010, Omar al-Baghdadi was killed in a joint US-Iraqi raid and in May 2010 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was appointed the new leader, he subsequently made many of his top commanders from the former Saddam government</li>

                            <li>In April 2013, al-Baghdadi said that al-Nusra has been created by ISI and they would be merging into a new group called Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham/Levant or ISIL</li>
                            <li>However, both al-Nusra and al-Qaeda rejected the merger saying they were not consulted beforehand</li>
                            <li>This led ISIL to split from the wider jihadist movement (al-Nusra and al-Qaeda) and they began their own unilateral expansion into Syria in April 2013 against both the Baathist regime and FSA militias, ISIL made rapid gains in northern Syria</li>
                            <li>In Jan 2014, Islamic Front militants and US backed FSA rebels launched an offensive against ISIL in Aleppo and Idlib but ISIL defended their territory by June 2014</li>

                            <!-- background -->
                            <li>Turkey has been fighting the PKK and other Kurdish groups for decades in southeastern and eastern Turkey</li>
                            <li>Turkey believes the PKK and YPG are terrorist organizations, the US says the PKK are terrorists but not the YPG</li>
                            <li>There was growing tension between the US and Turkey during the Syrian civil war since the US supported the SDF (primarily made up of YPG fighters), particulary training 30,000 SDF fighters on the Turkey border</li>
                            <li>In 2012, the Syrian army withdrew from Afrin and the YPG took control of the territory, the Syrian government and the Kurds remained aligned however and largely avoided each other during the war</li>
                            <li>In Feb 2016, when the rebel supply line in Aleppo was cut by Syrian forces, the SDF was able to successfully capture the town of Tell Rifaat, also in north Aleppo</li>
                            <li>This caused Turkish forces to respond with shelling into SDF positions in Syria and in 2017 Russian troops stationed themselves in Afrin to halt the Turkish attacks</li>
                            <li>In early Jan 2018, the Russian forces began withdrawing in anticipation of a Turkish offensive due to increased shelling between the YPG and Turkish FSA forces</li>


                            <!-- afrin offensive -->
                            <li>On 19 Jan 2018, Turkey announced they would be carrying out an offensive in Afrin</li>
                            <li>Turkey said objective of the mission is to "establish security and stability on our borders and region, to eliminate terrorists of PKK/KCK/PYD-YPG and ISIL."</li>
                            <li>On 20 Jan 2018, the Trukish offensive officially began after only airstrikes before, in the launch of the operation the TFSA and Turkish forces made some initial advances in the first 2 weeks of fighting</li>
                            <li>In Feb 2018, the Syrian government claimed they had reached a deal with YPG forces in Afrin and by the end of the month pro-Syrian forces entered YPG controlled areas in Afrin to support them against Turkey</li>
                            <li>Assad had also previously said in Jan 2018 that the Turkish invasion of Syria was terrorism, the Syrian govt also called the operation an ethnic cleansing policy</li>
                            <li>By the end of Feb 2018, Turkey and its allies had taken complete control of the border</li>
                            <li>By mid-March 2018, Turkish forces fully encircled the city of Afrin, some Kurdish citizens remained in the city to be human shields while 2000 fled in anticipation of a Turkish advance</li>
                            <li>During the next week after the encirclement, Turkish artillery increased and most SDF forces withdrew</li>
                            <li>On 18 March 2018, only a few days after the encirclement, Turkish forces had completely captured Afrin</li>

                            <!-- SDF insurgency -->
                            <li>Druing the rest of March 2018, the Turkish forces continued to clash with the remaining Syrian government loyalists left in Afrin</li>
                            <li>After Turkey took control of Afrin in March 2018, they set up a number of local councils to serve as civilian government</li>
                            <li>These councils were composed of Kurdish, Arab, and Turkmen civilian representatives, Turkey closely monitored the councils but they generally operated with autonomy to help restore society (including demining SDF landmines)</li>
                            <li>Turkey also had contentious policies, including resettling TFSA fighters and southern Syrian refugees into the empty homes that belonged to displaced Kurdish and Yazidi locals</li>
                            <li>After Turkey took control of Afrin, the YPG said they would continue to fight against Turkey/TFSA/SNA in the city using insurgent tactics, including attacking the families of rebel fighters or their sympathizers living in the city</li>
                            <li>In May 2018, an insurgency broke out (bombings and assassinations) in Afrin by a group of militants calling themselves the "Afrin Falcons", there was also another insurgent group the YPG said they were not affiliated with called the "Wrath of Olives"</li>
                            <li>By May-July 2018, the insurgency had mostly moved to rural areas on the outskirts of Afrin</li>
                            <li>In November 2018, the border crossing between Turkey and Afrin reopened</li>
                            <li>By Jan 2019, there had been 220 insurgent attacks in Afrin since Turkey took over, most of the attacks were by official YPG forces and the Wrath of Olives</li>
                            <li>The Afrin insurgency lasted until Aug 2019 and picked up again in retaliation for the Turkish Peace Spring operation in Oct 2019</li>
                            <li>Between 2019-2023, the insurgency slowed down byt continues with SDF/YPG militants continuing some bombings and sniping attacks on SNA forces in Afrin</li>
                            <li>A pro-Trukish company polled Turkish citizens who said 90% supported the operation, another poll also said that 90% of Turks thought the US was behind the PKK and YPG and anit-American sentiment rose due to the operation</li>
                            <li>During the operation, Turkish mainstream media fully supported the operation and said the US was the real enemy for supporting the Kurds</li>
                            <li>The media coverage was partly due to a Turkish government order on restrictions to reporting such as not mentioning attacks on civilians or covering protests against the operation and to only get their info on the war from the governemnt, this essentially made the media an arm of the government</li>
                            <li>During the operation, the Turkish governemnt arrested multiple journalists from Turkish Medical Association for spreading "terrorist propaganda", and have also arrested pro-Kurdish politicials and has detained over 800 people for social media posts protesting the offensive</li>
                            <li>Notable international critics of the operation: Syria, Egypt, France, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, </li>
                            <li>Notable international "Turkey has security reasons" states: Germany, Qatar, Russia, UK</li>

                            <li>Turkey-Russia agreement to create a DMZ in rebel held Idlib that would be enforced by Turkey and Russia</li>
                            <li>The HTS was one of the most powerful groups in Syria and controlled 2/3 of Idlib, they were previously an al-Qaeda affiliate</li>
                            <li>Other rebel groups in Idlib aligned with HTS include Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, Alliance to Support Islam, Katibat Jabal al-Islam, Ajnad al-Kavkaz, Jama'at Ansar al-Furqan in Bilad al Sham</li>
                            <li>The other main rebel group in Idlib at the time was National Front for Liberation (NFL), a coalition of the FSA and Syrian Liberation Front (primarily Ahrar al-Sham and Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement), who was heavily supported by Turkey</li>

                            <!-- deal -->
                            <li>Ater ISIL was defeated in the end of 2017, the Syrian Army began focusing on rebel held positions</li>
                            <li>The Syrian Army defeated many rebel held positions in Rif Dimashq after which the rebels fled to Idlib</li>
                            <li>By early Sept 2018, the Syrian Army had amassed troops and began shelling outside of Idlib, this included a massive bombing campaign by Russia (the largest one to take place in Idlib)</li>
                            <li>Ahead of the imminent Syrian government assault, the UN warned that Idlib could turn into a bloodbath due to there being 100,000 rebels and 3,000,000 civilains in the area</li>
                            <li>On 13 Sept, it was announced that Turkey's Erdogan and Russia's Putin would meet in Iran to discuss a path forward</li>
                            <li>On 16 Sept 2018, a deal was struck in Sochi that established a Turkish-Russian patrolled DMZ in rebel held Idlib where Syrian govt forces couldn't attack but "radical" rebels like the HTS had to leave, "moderate" rebels such as the Turkish backed National Front for Liberation could stay</li>
                            <li>The Syrian governemnt "welcomed" the deal but the Turkistan Islamic Party, Guardians of Religion Organization (Al-Qaeda in Syria), Ansar al-Tawhid, Ansar al-Din Front, and Ansar al-Islam rejected the deal, Tahrir al-Sham partially agreed to the deal</li>

                            <!-- deal fails -->
                            <li>By 19 Sept 2018, pro-Syrian govt forces continued shelling the HTS in Idlib and Latakia</li>
                            <li>On 2 Oct 2018, the HTS and Syrian govt attempted to revive the deal but this new deal again fell apart when pro-Syrian forces again began shelling the HTS in Idlib at the end of Oct 2018</li>
                            <li>The deal had fallen appart due to it never being fully implemented, which led to the HTS taking over almost all of Idlib which inevitablty led to atrillery battles between them and the Syrian govt forces</li>
                            <li>Another failure of the deal was that the Turkish-Russian patrols were never enforced either, due to rebel forces not allowing them into Idlib</li>
                            <li>After the failre of the deal, in May 2019, the Syrian Government launched an offensive against the rebels in Idlib in the First Idlib Offensive</li>
                            <li>In Aug 2019, there was another attempt to revive the deal and many rebel groups in Idblib accepted, however the HTS refused to leave, which was one of the core terms of the deal</li>
                            <li>This led to the Syrian Army to launch another offensive where they captured significant gains in Idlib</li>
                            <li>By Feb 2020, the Syrian Army had captured the M5 highway, a major checkpoint in Idlib and most important highway in Syria</li>
                            <li>In March 2020, Russia and Turkey came to a new cease-fire agreement with new joint Russian and Turkish patrols in a 12km wide corridor along the M4 highway running in Idlib and Latakia</li>

                            <li>The offensive saw a large amount of airstrikes by Russian and Syrian government forces</li>
                            <li>Syrian government side: Russia, Iran, Hezbollah</li>
                            <li>Rebel side: HTS, National Front for Liberation (NFL), Turkistan Islamic Party (TIP), TFSA</li>

                            <!-- background -->
                            <li>In Sept 2018, the Turkish-Russian Sochi deal was brokered that required HTS to leave Idlib, the NFL could stay though</li>
                            <li>The deal was never fully implemented and in early 2019, the HTS launched an offensive against the NFL, which led to the HTS establishing almost full control over Greater Idlib</li>
                            <li>This led to the HTS and Syrian government forces stationed on the DMZ line to frequently exchange fire</li>
                            <li>In April 2019, Syria and Russian air forces launched an extended air campaign on the rebels in the DMZ, Russia said this was justified since the rebels never implemented the deal</li>

                            <!-- offensive -->
                            <li>On 30 Arpil 2019, the situation escalated when a large number of Syrian Army troops were deployed to Hama and Idlib ahead of an offensive</li>
                            <li>On the same day, Syrian and Russian air forces launched their largest air campaign (lasted 6 days) in Greater Idlib in preparation for the offensive, it came 3 days after the HTS killed 22 pro-gov fighters on the frontlines</li>
                            <li>On May 6 2019, the airstrikes ended and the Syrian Army launched their offensive on the HTS and NFL in Greater Idlib</li>
                            <li>The Syrian govt said the assault was provoked by rebels in the DMZ, the rebels said the government wanted to capture the M4 and M5 highways</li>
                            <li>From 6-17 May 2019, the Syrian Army made some advances, including capturing Kafr Nabudah and Qalaat al-Madiq</li>
                            <li>On 18 May 2019, the Syrian Army declared a 3-day ceasefire and put the offensive on hold</li>
                            <li>However, the rebels groups including the NFL and TIP continued to attack Syrian government positions, not respecting the ceasefire</li>
                            <li>On 21 May 2019, the ceasefire ended and the rebels (NFL and HTS) launched a counter offensive which ended with them recapturing Kafr Nabudah</li>
                            <li>On 22 May 2019, the HTS reported that the Syrian governemnt had used a chemical attack (chlorine gas munitions) against them, however, the SOHR said there was no proof that the government used any chemical weapons and the US House also said the attacks couldn't be confirmed</li>
                            <li>Fighting at Kafr Nabudah continued until the Syrian Army recaptured the town on 26 May 2019, pro-government forces continued artillery and airstrikes in Idlib and Hama with increasing intensity</li>
                            <li>On 30 May 2019, there was a second attempt at a ceasefire but it quickly failed due to a Turkish demand that the SAA withdraw from all areas they had captured in the offensive, which Russia rejected leading them to conduct another air campaign</li>
                            <li>On 7 June 2019, the rebels (NFL and HTS) launched a new counteroffensive in northern Hama</li>
                            <li>On 12 June 2019, the SAA announced another 72 hours ceasefire following Turkish and Russian negotiations, the daily continuous Syria and Russian airstrikes were also halted, Ahrar al-Sham and NFL rejected the ceasefire</li>
                            <li>By 16 June 2019, fighting had fully resumed and the Syrian Republican Guard (special elite President's troops - Assad's own unit) entered the offensive</li>
                            <li>On 13-17 July 2019, the Syrian Army (Tiger Forces and Republican Guard) launched a renewed offensive in thr Al-Ghab Plain, Russian and Syrian air strikes also increased</li>
                            <li>On 21 July 2019, the rebels attempted an attack on the village of Qasabiyeh in southern Idlib, however the Syrian army repelled them</li>
                            <li>On 26 July 2019, the UN said that over 450 civilians had been killed in Syria in the previous 10 says, 103 of them were due to Russian/Syrian airstrikes and 11 had been killed in the past 3 days by rebels</li>
                            <li>On 28 July 2019, the Syrian army launched a new counteroffensive on rebel held positions and captured the villages of Tell Malah and Jubbayn</li>
                            <li>On 1 Aug 2019, the Syrian Army agreed to halt the offensive in exchange for a full implementation of the Sochi deal in a fourth ceasefire attempt, by August 3 the ceasefire fell apart with pro-government forces infiltrating rebel positions and heavy artillery continuing, on Aug 4 the HTS fully refused the ceasefire since it said they had to withdrawal from the area</li>
                            <li>On Aug 5 2019, the Syrian governenment fully called off the ceasefire due to the HTS rejection and went back to full operations, </li>
                            <li>By 11 Aug 2019, the Syrian army had captured the strategic town of al-Habit in Idlib from the HTS</li>
                            <li>On 13-14 Aug 2019, the Syrian Army began advancing to the city of Khan Shaykhun (one of the largest rebel strongholds in Idlib), by Aug 20 the Syrian Army had taken full control of the city</li>
                            <li>On Aug 19 2019, there was a Turkish military convoy headed for Khan Shaykhun through the M5 highway and it was targeted by Syrian air forces multiple times, Turkey condemned the strikes saying they were transporting supplies to a Turkish observation post but the Syrian govt rejected this and said they were moving weapons</li>
                            <li>On 23 Aug 2019, the Syrian government finally captured the remaining rebel pocket in Hama, they then surrounded a Turkish observation post within the same area</li>
                            <li>On 30 Aug 2019, the Syrian governement said they would launch a unilateral ceasefire in the DMZ (which was now almost entirely under their control), on Aug 31 SOHR reported that the Syrian/Russian airstrikes that had been going on daily had been fully halted</li>

                    <h2 class="title">Operation Peace Spring</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <!-- Overview -->
                            <li>Turkish offensive in north-east Syria, was the Turkish Army and the SNA against the SDF and later the Syrian Army too</li>
                            <li>Started after Trump ordered the withdraw of US troops from northeast Syria who had been supporting the Kurds there</li>
                            <li>Offensive displaced 300,000 people and resulted in 70 civilians dead in Syria and 20 civilians dead in Turkey, in Nov 2019 94,000 of the displaced had returned to their homes and 100,000 were still displaced</li>
                            <li>Goal: Erdogon says the goal was to expel the SDF due to their ties with the PKK, he wanted to then resettle 3.6 million Syrian refugees that were in Turkey (this had large public support in Turkey) in the area that the Kurds used to be, this has been criticised as ethnic cleansing</li>
                            <li>Condemnations: Russia said Turkey had a right to self defense but later switched its position and deployed troops, 10 EU countries and Canada imposed an arms embargo on Turkey, the US sanctioned Turkey, Assad was initially against the SDF but after making a deal with them switched to fighting Turkey, many human rights groups including Amnesty and SOHR accused Turkey of commiting war crimes in the operation</li>
                            <li>The domestic support for Peace Spring was 79% in Turkey, it was 71% for Olive Branch, however the government still detained about 300 online critics and opposition members for their criticism of the operation, which Turkey made illegal to criticise the operation as "terrorism"</li>

                            <!-- Northern Syria Buffer zone -->
                            <li>On 7 Aug 2019, after months of Turkey threatening to invade northern Syria to eradicate the SDF, the US and Turkey struck a deal to establish the northern Syria buffer zone (DMZ safe zone between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, notably excluding Manbij, where the YPG and YPJ would withdraw and give up to the SDF)</li>
                            <li>The deal aimed to address Turkey's security concerns while also allowing the Kurds to retain the areas they were in</li>
                            <li>The DMZ was administered by the SDF (who administered the Kurdish region of Rojava) and was enforced by the US and Turkey</li>
                            <li>The SDF and the US were satisfied with the deal (SDF was US main partner in fighting ISIL) but Turkey actually didn't like it (because the SDF was composed of the YPG, YPJ, and YPD which Turkey thought was part of the PKK which they said were terrorists, Turkey thought the SDF was just an extension of the PKK) leading them to try to expand the buffer zone multiple times (all of which failed to the SDF and US forces being there)</li>
                            <li>During the implementation timeline, the SDF partially withdrew and joint US-Turkish patrols began, however, by 1 Oct 2019 Turkey began dismissing the buffer zone and threatening an invasion</li>
                            <li>Eventually, at the end of Sept 2019, Erdogon posed an ultimatum to the SDF to have them withdrawal from their positions, which the SDF ignored</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2019, the DMZ deal collapsed before it was fully implemented after Turkey's dismissmisal of the agreement on Oct 1</li>
                            <li>On 6 Oct 2019, US Pres Trump abandoned the deal and ordered the withdrawl of US forces from northern Syria after a phone call with Erdogan, allowing Erdogan to launch Peace Spring</li>

                            <!-- Operation -->
                            <li>Preparation for the operation began in July 2019, following the Oct 6 US Trump withdrawl, Turkey had the green light to conduct the offensive, the Kurds called the US withdrawl a betrayal</li>
                            <li>Trump was criticised for his decision as it was a beytrayal of the Kurds, undermining US credibility as an ally, and allowing Russia to become the main power broker in the Middle East</li>
                            <li>On 9 Oct 2019, the operation officially began with Turkish strikes and tank fire on SDF held towns and by the end of the day a ground offensive too, the start date was symbolic as it was the day that PKK leader Adbullah Ocalan was expelled from Syria by Assad in 1998</li>
                            <li>Over the coming days the Turkish forces would capture multiple checkpoints, leading to a deal between the SDF and Syrian army on 14 Oct 2019 which allowed the SAA to enter the towns of Kobani and Manbij in order to deter the Turkish forces from trying to take it</li>
                            <li>Later on 14 Oct 2019, Trump announced that the US would fully withdraw from Syria except for the Al-Tanf base, by Oct 17 the US had withdrawn and destroyed their military base near Kobani (their largest in Syria)</li>

                            <!-- Ceasefire -->
                            <li>On 17 Oct 2019, US VP Mike Pence announced Turkey and the US agreed to a 120 hour ceasefire in Syria between the SDF and Turkey if the SDF withdrew from all its positions on the border that were apart of the designated safe zones from the failed Turkish buffer zone</li>
                            <li>Pence said that after Turkey stopped their ceasefire then all the sanctions that the US imposed on them would be lifted and there would be no further sanctions, the deal was called another US betreyal by the Kurds</li>
                            <li>On 20 Oct 2019, the SDF withdrew from Ras al-Ayn and the US continued to withdraw, despite this and the ceasefire, some Turkish attacks were still occuring</li>
                            <li>On Oct 22 2019, Putin and Erdogan met in Sochi and agreed to extend the deal 150 hours if the SDF moved back farther including from Tal Rifaat and Manbij, the deal had excluded the US with the buffer zone being enforces by the SAA and Russian forces</li>
                            <li>The new deal was known as the Sochi Agreement or Second northern Syria Buffer Zone</li>
                            <li>After the deal, Putin called Assad, who said the deal had the full backing of the Syrian government and by Oct 27 Syrian army troops were being sent to enforce the buffer zone</li>
                            <li>The SDF also said they accepted the deal 5 days after it was made, they said they would rather work with Russia and Assad than be genocided, the SDF was then incorporated into the Syrian army and the Kurds in the area came under control of Assad, the operation severely diminished the propsect of Kurdish autonomy</li>
                            <li>On 23 Oct 2019, Trump said he was lifting sanctions "permanently" on Turkey due to there being a ceasefire, Trump was heavily criticised for this as it was a further betrayal of the Kurds</li>
                            <li>In the coming days there was some small scirmishes between Syrian army and Turkish forces, the US also sent some troops back into Syria to "protect the Eastern oil fields from ISIL"</li>
                            <li>On 1 Nov 2019, joint Russian and Turkish patrols along the buffer zone began, they would continue until Jan 2020; the patrols were met with protests from the Northern Syrian residents and the Turkish patrols responded to these with tear gas</li>
                            <li>After Peace Spring, there were concerns that ISIL may resurge due to the SDF having 10,000 ISIL prisoners at the time due to them being the main allies of the US coalition</li>
                            <li>In Oct and Nov 2019, there were reports that ~900 ISIL prisoners had escaped due to the YPG freeing them or the SDF reporting they escaped due to Turkish strikes</li>
                            <li>Between Jan-Feb 2020, the Russian and American forces had heightened tensions with the US forces blocking the Russian forces multiple times</li>
                            <li>In early Feb 2020, Turkish rejected the joint patrols and left them to only Russia but by the end of Feb they had continued the joint patrols as they were</li>


                            <!-- occupation -->
                            <li>In May 2011, Turkey first proposed a safe zone in northern Syria but the US and other western allies didn't accept this, by 2014 however the US and Turkey negotiated a deal for a safe zone following the advance of ISIL in Iraq</li>
                            <li>Turkey and Syria had been friendly from 2000-2010 but Turkey condemned Syria in the outbreak of the civil war and shortly after began providing support for the FSA against Assad</li>
                            <li>In 2016 the safe zones failed due to disagreements between the US and Turkey</li>
                            <li>After Euphrates Shield, Olive Branch, and Peace Spring, Turkey occupied territories in the northern areas of Aleppo, Raqqa and Al-Hasakah</li>
                            <li>Euphrates Shield: villages between Azaz and al-Rai, such as Kafr Kalbin; Kafrah; Sawran; Ihtaimlat; Dabiq; Turkman Bareh; Kafr Elward; Ghoz; Ghaytun; Akhtarin; Baruza; Tall Tanah; Kaljibrin; Qebbet al-Turkmen; Ghandoura; Arab Hassan Sabghir; Mahsenli; Qabasin and Halwanji.</li>
                            <li>Olive Branch: entire Afrin district</li>
                            <li>Peace Spring: Ras al-Ayn, Tell Abyad, Suluk, Mabrouka and Manajir and cut the M4 highway</li>
                            <li>During the Turkish occupation of northern Syria they have conducted ethnic cleansing by moving in Syrian refugees from Turkey into the homes of the Kurds that used to live in Afrin</li>
                            <li>More than 200,000 people fled from Afrin District during the Turkish intervention by March 2018, while 458,000 displaced persons from other parts of Syria were settled in Afrin following the Turkish intervention.</li>
                            <li>The occupaiton zone is formally governed by the Syrian Interim Government but defacto ruled by a number of autonomous local councils that work closely with Turkey and are generally under the direct influence of Turkey</li>
                            <li>Regional expert Joshua Landis has said Turkey "is prepared to, in a sense, quasi-annex this region" to prevent it from being retaken by the Syrian government.</li>

                            <li>Operation was launched by the Syrian Army with Russia, Iran, and Hezbollah, against the SNA, HTS, Rouse of Believers, and the Turkish Islamic Party</li>
                            <li>Eventually led to Turkish intervention with Operation Spring Shield in Feb 2020</li>
                            <li>Ended in a ceasefire mediated by Erdogan and Putin</li>

                            <!-- background -->
                            <li>In 2018, the Syrian government was victorious in the siege of Eastern Ghouta, the Southern Damascus offensive, and the completion of rebel evacuations from eastern Qalamoun which concluded their Rif Dimashq campaign</li>

                            <li>From 2000-2010, Turkey and Syria were allies but after the civil war broke out, Turkey strongly condemned Assad and shortly after began funding the FSA in a push to topple Assad</li>
                            <li>The FSA started out as a group of defectors from the Syrian Army who fled to Turkey and were trained to eventually form the FSA under the supervision of Turkish intelligence</li>
                            <li>Turkey also supported the Army of Conquest (al-Nusra, Ahrar al-Sham, Sham Legion) until 2014 when Turkey declared al-Nusra as a terrorist organization</li>

                            <li>"The witness testimony contradicts Turkey's denials that it sent arms to Syrian rebels and, by extension, contributed to the rise of Islamic State, now a major concern for the NATO member"</li>

                            <li>Since ISIL was formally formed in June 2014, Turkey faces numerous allegations (from US, Russia, Europe, Kurds, SOHR, Hezbollah, Assad, basically everyone) of supporting ISIL, including that Turkish logistical and financial support, that Turkey largely refused to directly engage with ISIL, that Turkey allowed for some 30,000 ISIL militants to traverse Turkish soil to enter Syria, and that wounded ISIL militants were often treated for free in southeastern Turkish hospitals</li>

                            <li>Over the course of the civil war, Turkey and NATO tensions grew, but NATO was left with only small criticisms of Turkey due to its key poisition between Europe and the Middle East</li>

                            <li>By 2018, Turkey had accepted over 3.5 million Syrian refugees since the start of the war, and after Peace Spring in 2019 Turkey said they would begin resettling Syrian refugees in Turkish controlled areas it had invaded and Turkey would pay for it if necessary, Turkey began resettling the refugees in Dec 2019</li>

                            <li>While the Syrian government was shifting away from Iran and Syrian public opinion was in favor against Iranian influence, support for Iranian involvement in Syria remained strong among the Iranian public due to religious motivations and security concerns even though there were almost 10,000 Iranian casualties in Syria</li>
                            <li>After the 2024 collapse of Assad, Iran franticly evacuated Quds Forces commanders, IRGC members, diplomatic staff and their families as well as Iranian citizens</li>

                            <li>In Sept 2015, Russia launched their military intervention in Syria after a formal request by Assad to help fight against the rebels and ISIL</li>
                            <li>Just before Russia stepped in with billions of dollars to help Assad, his government was extremely close to falling (only held 26% of Syria)</li>
                            <li>Russia quickly began a large airstrike campaign on FSA and Army of Conquest positions, Syria said these airstrikes were to combat terrorism (all rebels were terrorists to Assad)</li>
                            <li>This was depite Russia saying their intervention was only to combat "terrorism" like ISIL and al-Qaeda affiliates, they instead used a scorched Earth strategy on civilian and Syrian opposition strongholds</li>
                            <li>However, weeks after the intervention, Russian officials disclosed their main goal in Syria was to prop up the Baathist government and capture territories from US backed rebels, with a side goal of curbing US influence in the region</li>
                            <li>In 2016, 80% of Russian airstrikes targeted Syrian opposition forces fighting against ISIL</li>
                            <li>Russia also sent military advisors for training and PMCs like Wagner to support Assad</li>
                            <li>By Dec 2017, Russia announced they would deploy to Syria permanently due to the fact that Assad's control of Syria had dwindled from 26% in 2015 to just 17% in early 2017</li>
                            <li>The Russian intervention finally allowed Assad to turn the tides against the rebels, after recapturing Aleppo is Dec 2016, recapturing Palmyra and Deir ez-Zor from ISIL in 2017, capturing Daraa and the collapse of the Southern Front in 2018, and the complete seizure of the M5 highway in 2019-2020</li>
                            <li>From the intervention, Russia became a great-power on the world stage against the US again, with gaurantees access to the Mediterranean, allowing them to conduct operations in the Red Sea and Libya</li>
                            <li>Tartus naval base: Russian naval base on sea port in Tartus established in 1971 under a a Soviet-Syrian agreement, is Russia's only access to the Mediterranean, after Assad's fall in 2024 all Russian warships exacuated from the port</li>
                            <li>Khmeimim Air Base: located south of Latakia city, became a component of Russia's permanent presence (along with Tartus port) in Syria in 2017, in the 2024 fall of Assad Russia evacuated all assets from the airbase</li>

                            <li>In 2020, a BMJ and UN investigation also found Russia was using "weaponized health-care" through its hospital bombardment campaigns; by pursuing a deliberate policy of bombing ambulances, clinical facilities, hospitals and all medical infrastructure</li>
                            <li>The UN and the west has denounced Russia's intervention in Syria and the US imposed economic sanctions on Russia in response to the intervention</li>
                            <li>Depite a renewal of Russian airstrikes in Nov 2024, they were no able to stop the HTS offensive and Assad fell, resulting in Russia quickly beginning to withdraw their forces</li>

                            <li>Other countries that supported the FSA were the UK, Norway, Hamas, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf States</li>
                            <li>After the 2011 protests, the FSA was successful in waging guerilla tactics and turning the Syrian revolution into a full blown insurgency by 2012, this was due to mass defections (10,000 by Oct 2011 according to US) from the Syrian Army due to Assads brutal repression of the protests</li>
                            <li>The FSA's guerilla tactics included ambushes on security forces and Shabiha, in which they relied on hit and run tactics to force the Syrian army to withdrawl rather than occupying territory themselves</li>
                            <li>In Nov 2011, the FSA carried out an attack on a Syrian Army intelligence complex in Damascus, an airbase in Homs, ambushes on SAA convoys, a raid on an SAA intel building in Idlib, and clashes in Daraa</li>
                            <li>In 2012, the FSA focused on protecting/defending civilians but also assassinating the Assad regimes top leadership, causing IRGC to get involved by sending thousands of troops</li>

                            <li>Between March-Dec 2012, the FSA began to lose influence and territory due to lacking dicipline/leadership/western support, allowing Islamic militias to emerge as the dominant armed opposition</li>

                            <li>By 2015, the FSA had become a decentralizeed fighting force, in which it wasn't an army but a collection of diverse militant groups who all identified as FSA</li>
                            <li>From 2015-16, the Russian intervention severly damaged the FSA further and eroded a significant amount of their territorial gains that they still had, which was only in Aleppo and Hama</li>
                            <li>By 2016, the group that once had a formal military structure, had disipated into more of an identity that various opposition groups used</li>
                            <li>In the 2016 Turkish intervention, a number of divided militias that identified as FSA began relying more on Turkey for support</li>

                            <li>The merger was led by Abu Jaber Shayyk, the second emir of Ahrar al-Sham, who called for a new stage of Syrian opposition by waging "popular jihad" to oust the Baathists and Hezbollah from Syria and establish an Islamic government</li>
                            <li>Since 2017, HTS has been mostly ran by former JFS and Ahrar al-Sham leaders</li>
                            <li>After HTS was formed there were various assassinations on its supporters, leading them to launch a crackdown on Al-Qaeda loyalists within their ranks</li>
                            <li>This cemented their power in Idlib and led them to launch a "Syrianization" programme that would establish a civilian administration that worked with humanitarian organizations to provide public services, this included a legal and educational system implementing Sunni Islamic thought, although they still allowed pre-existing non-Islamic schools to continue operating</li>
                            <li>However, depite being an Islamic organization, HTS hasn't been as extreme as the Taliban or ISIL, including minimum taxation, not forcing hijabs, not discouraging women's education; they had a religous police for a sort time in 2020 but dismantled it almost immediately</li>
                            <li>The HTS has also worked to improve relations with minority groups in Idlib, including the Druze and including helping Christains to reopen their chruches, they also assured they wouldn't discriminate against the Alawites after Assad fell including giving amnesty to former regime soldiers unless they committed war crimes</li>

                            <li>Designated as a terrorist group by the UN, US, EU, UK, Canada, Turkey, and others, but after the fall of Assad, western states are warming up to the HTS</li>
                            <li>In Nov 2017, the HTS created the Syrian Salvation Government as an opposition to Assad and the government in Idlib, thus presenting themselves as a legitimate governing body with the SSG acting as a state building project for the HTS</li>
                            <li>The SGG stands in opposition to Assad and the Syrian Interim Government, it has 11 ministries led by a PM and says that Islamic law is the only source of legislation</li>
                            <li>After Assad fell in Dec 2024, the Baathist regime transferred the PM and all minister positions to the SSG counterparts, with SSG pm Mohammed al-Bashir becoming Syria's new PM</li>

                            <li>Coalition of left-wing Kurdish/Arab militias and rebel groups serving as the military wing of the AANES, it also includes several FSA factions</li>
                            <li>The SDF is militarily lead by the YPG, which is designated a terrorist group by Turkey and Qatar</li>
                            <li>The SDF is allied and has been supplied by the US in their fight against ISIL</li>
                            <li>The SDF is opposed to Turkey, who view them as an extension of the PKK (which Turkey views as a terrorist group), and the TFSA; they are also opposed to ISIL and all al-Qaeda affiliates in the Syrian civil war</li>
                            <li>In Oct 2015, the SDF was founded, claiming it wanted to create a democratic and federalized Syria; the US convinced the SDF to incorporate the word "democratic" in its name due to Turkey's concerns over the YPG's ties to the PKK.</li>
                            <li>The founding groups were the YPG, YPJ, Al-Sanadid Forces, Syriac Military Council, Liwa Thuwar al-Raqqa, Euphrates Volcano, Army of Revolutionaries, and the Brigade Groups of al-Jazira.</li>
                            <li>Up until 2019, the SDF primarily focused on fighting ISIL, in March 2019 they declared a total territorial defeat of ISIL in Syria</li>
                            <li>After the defeat of ISIL, the SDF turned their focus to fighting the TFSA and Turkey in northern Syria.</li>
