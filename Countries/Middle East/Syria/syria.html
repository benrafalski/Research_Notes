        <p>Located in southwestern Asia. Territory included Golan Heights that is occupied by Israel since the 1967 six day war. The capital is Damascus. They gained independence in 1946. Ever since then, life has been marked by social, religious, and political unrest. In 1970, authoritarian ruler Pres. Hafez al-Assad came to power and focused on military power to take back the territory they lost to Israel in 1967. In 2000, Hafaez died and Bashar al-Assad took over. He would continue his father's authoritarian style of rule leading to the outbreak of the Syrian civil war in 2011. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The authoritarian regime under Assad was a cult of personality around him and gained popularity due to their polices of economic development, land reform, promotion of education, strengthening of the military, and vehement opposition to Israel.</li>
                        <li>As president, Hafez brought stability to Syria and established it as a major power in the Middle East</li>
                        <li>Assad reverted the radical socialist policies of the Jadid regime and strengthened privatization in the economy after taking over in 1971, despite the 1973 consitution only allowing for public, collective and individual property</li>
                        <li>Assads foreign policy consisted of strengthening relations with the Soviets to develop the Syrian economy/military, normalizing relations with Egypt/Saudi Arabia to establish a "Cairo-Damascus-Riyadh axis" against Israel</li>
                        <li>Due to this and harsh repression of anti-Baathist opponents, the Assad government saw large stability in Syria with the alliance of the Baath Party, the military, and the bureaucracy (which was led by Assad and supported by and Alawite network of officials and officers)</li>
                        <li>The majority Sunni population outside of Damascus and in merchant groups were the main opponents of the Baathist-Alawite government</li>
                        <li>Hafez's foreign policy was marked by wars with Israel during the 1960s-70s, a rivalry with Baathists Iraq, and intervention in Lebanon.</li>
                        <li>Arab nationalism flourished under Assad, emphasizing the Palestinain problem, socialism, and anti-imperialism and was brought to the cities and sponsored in media (movies, TV, radio) by the Baath government</li>
                        <li>In the 1980s, Syria's economy began to stagnate and saw inflation and government corruption due to a weak private sector and military spending, especially in Lebanon</li>
                        <li>Assad turned to the oil rich states in the Middle East for aid and turned to China for military supplies after the USSR fell in 1991.</li>

                            <li>Assad appealed to the Aflaqites directly and recruited them to build his power over the larger Jadid faction in the Baathist government</li>
                            <li>After Syria failed in their intervention in the Black September crisis in Jordan, Assad began planning to overthrow Jadid</li>

                            <li>On November 12, the National Congress was broken up and Assad had Jadid and his associated arrested</li>

                            <li>Later in 1971, Assad shifted to viewing the Aflaqites in the government as a threat to his power and conducted a showtrial on Michel Aflaq and former Syrian President Amin al-Hafiz</li>
                            <li>Both Aflaq and Hafiz were sentenced to death and Assad also purged 99 other party members by imprisoning them</li>
                            <li>This purge completely wiped the Aflaq influence from the Syrian Baath party</li>
                            <li>The constitution only allowed for Sunnis to become president so Assad faked being a Sunni by praying in Sunni mosques even though he was Alawite to gain the support of the ulama</li>
                            <li>He also appointed many Sunnis to high ranking positions in the Baathist government</li>
                            <li>In March 1971, Assad was sworn in as president</li>
                            <li>Assad had consolidated his power over Syria and Alawites began to occupy coveted positions in all Syrian sectors</li>

                            <li>The 1973 constitution reinforced the the leading role of the Baathist Party in Syria and transformed the revolutionary state into a Presidential Monarchy in which all power was consalidated under the Syrian President (Assad) in a one-party (Baathist) socialist state</li>
                            <li>Under the new consitution, the President served for 7-year terms with no term limits and was nominated by the Baath Party and approved by parliament</li>
                            <li>The consitution not requiring the President to be Muslim resulted in riots in Hama, Homs, and Aleppo organized by the Muslim Brotherhood and the ulama</li>
                            <li>In March 1973, Assad folded to the pressure and returned the Muslim President requirement then obtained a fatwa from a Lebanese cleric proclaiming that Alawites were a part of Shia Islam</li>
                            <li>The consitution also emphasized pan-Arab ideology and positioned Syria as one region in the wider Arab nation and calls out the need to protect against imperialism and Zionism</li>
                            <li>This gave Assad full control over the military, party, and bureaucracy</li>
                            <li>Assad further strengthened his power by assigning Alawite loyalists to high ranking positions in various state institutions</li>

                            <li>In 1967 during the six day war, Israel captured half of the Golan Heights from Syria</li>
                            <li>Following the six day war, the Arab states would hold the position that were would be no peace, no recognition, and no negotiations with Israel</li>
                            <li>The Yom Kippur War was from October 6-25, 1973, led by a coalition of Arab states (Egypt, Syria, Jordan) headed by Syria and Egypt against Israel</li>
                            <li>In the weeks before the war, Syrian troops were detected on the border and Israel sent reinforcements to the Golan Heights</li>
                            <li>Initially, Israel was going to attack Syria preemtively but decided against it (in fear of losing US support) and then the war officially began when Egypt and Syria suprise attacked Israel (on Yom Kippur, CIA even failed to predict the attack) by invading the Sinai and the Golan Heights (which were captured in the 1967 war)</li>
                            <li>During the war, Egypt unexpectedly ceased hostilities exposing the Syrian front, this made Assad resent Anwar Sadat until his death.</li>
                            <li>The IDF initially sustained heavy loses against the Syrian forces and lost the southern Golan Heights on October 8 (Israel even considered using nukes in fear of total defeat, until the US resupplied them on Oct 14), but by Oct 10 Israel had recaptured the Golan territory and pushed the Syrians back across the Purple Line (pre-war ceasefire line)</li>
                            <li>On Oct. 11, Israel chose to push deeper into Syria and reached within 30km of Damascus but were eventually halted by Iraqi and Jordanian counterattacks from within Syria on October 12-21</li>
                            <li>The Egyptians and Syrians were both being funnelled arms by the Soviets (starting Oct 9 and some Soviet personnel even fought alongside the Syrians) and Israel by the US (starting Oct 14)</li>
                            <li>An initial UN ceasefire was brokered on October 22 (resolution 338) but fighting continued with Israel pushing to the outskirts of Cairo</li>
                            <li>This forced a second ceasefire on October 25  that ended the war due to the dangerously heightened tensions between the US and the Soviets</li>
                            <li>In December 1973 there was a peace summit in Geneva between Israel and the Arab states mediated by the Soviets and the US but the confrence ended when Syria refused attendance</li>
                            <li>Syrian and Israeli forces continued to fight in an attrition war into 1974 until a final disengagement agreement was agreed upon due to Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy in May 1974 (official end of the Yom Kippur War)</li>
                            <li>Under the agreement, Israel gave back mount Hermon and the Quneitra to Syria and pulled back to the Purple Line, however Israel now controlled more territory than after 1967.</li>
                            <li>A UN buffer zone was established by the UN Disengagement and Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan Heights and the agreement has remained in place until today</li>

                            <li>In April 1975, the Lebanese Civil War broke out between Lebanese Christian militias and Palestinian insurgents, mainly the PLO</li>
                            <li>In January 1976, Assad brokered a truce between the two sides but covertly sent Syrian PLA (Pal Liberation Army) troops into Lebanon inorder to bring the PLO back under Syrian influence</li>
                            <li>Despite the truce, hostilities continued and the Christian President of Lebanon requested Syria to formally intervene in the war</li>
                            <li>In June 1976, Syria sent 12,000 regular Syrian troops to fight against leftist Pal militias due to their connections to Sunni Islamists and the Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>In August 1976, the Lebanese Christian Maronite forces, supported by Syria, attacked the Pal militias at the Tel al-Zaatar refugee camp, killing 1000-1500 civilians, which unleashed heavy critisism on Syria from the Arab world</li>
                            <li>In October 1976, Syria accepted an Arab League proposal that gave Syria a mandate to keep 40,000 troops in Lebanon as part of an Arab Deterrent Force to bring the war to an end and restore calm</li>
                            <li>In 1977, the Syrian forces in the ADF took part in the 100 days war subconflict of the civil war in Beirut</li>
                            <li>From December 1980-June 1981, the Battle of Zehleh took place between the Lebanese forces (aided by the Christian townspeople) and the Syrian ADF (aided by the PLO)</li>
                            <li>The battle broke out when the Syrians closed all roads in and out of Zahleh (imposing a siege) fearing that Israel would collude with the Lebanese forces and attack Syrian territiry (Zahleh is close to the Bekka Valley along the Syrian-Lebanese border), causing the LF to attack in fear of a Syrian invasion on Zahleh</li>
                            <li>In 1982, the Syrian's primary mission shifted to protecting the Beirut-Damascus highway (outside the Bekka Valley) since it was their main supply line to Lebanon</li>
                            <li>On June 8, 1982, IDF and Syrian forces began to fight each other in the Battle of Jezzine</li>
                            <li>By June 11, the IDF had pushed the PLO and Syrian forces to Beirut and a ceasefire between the groups was established on June 12</li>
                            <li>On June 13, the ceasefire fell apart and fighting continued until around June 22</li>
                            <li>In October 1990, Syria launched a major operation with their Lebanese allies into Beirut and took the capital forcing the Christian leader Aoun to flee to Paris</li>

                            <li>This included the Muslim Brotherhood, who had been part of the Syrian parliament before the coup and disagreed with the Baathist ultra-secular foundation, wanting Syria to be an Islamic Republic</li>
                            <li>This culminated in the Hama uprising in 1964 led by Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>In the aftermath of the Hama revolt being crushed the Fighting Vanguard was formed</li>
                            <li>The Fighting Vanguard was led by Marwan Hadid and was a spliter group of the Brotherhood due to the Brotherhood's rejection of Hadid's calls for jihad against the Baathists</li>
                            <li>In March 1973, Assad's new consitution added further to the Muslim anger after it didn't require the President to be Muslim</li>
                            <li>After the October war in 1973, Syria also fell into an economic downturn</li>
                            <li>In June 1976, Hadid was captured and died in prison and the remaining members of the Vanguard vowed to avenge his dead</li>
                            <li>Later in 1976, the Vanguard would carry out terror attacks, including explosions and assassinations aimed at prominent military/government officers/bureaucrats, most of which were Alawite</li>
                            <li>This resulted in a series of indiscriminate jihadist attacks on the minority Alawite community</li>
                            <li>Throughout the uprising, the insurgents would be supported with arms and supplies by the Iraqi government of Saddam Hussein</li>
                            <li>Jisr ash-Shughur massacre: in March 1980 a bunch of Jisr ash-Shughur residents marched on the Baath headquarters and set it on fire, the military responded by arresting 200 people then executing almost all of them</li>
                            <li>The insugency concluded in 1982 following the Hama massacre when the Brotherhood was defeated</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>After the initial breakout of the Islamic uprising, the terror attacks continued into 1979</li>
                            <li>In June 1979, at the Aleppo artillery school, all the school cadets were called to an urgent meeting in the dining hall where they (83 Alawite cadets) were massacred by gunmen with automatic weapons and grenades</li>
                            <li>The massacre was planned by Adnan Uqla, a Vanguard commander, who committed the massacre without permission of the Vanguard's leader, Hisham Jumbaz</li>
                            <li>In August 1976, the Brotherhood effectively claimed responsibility when they declared jihad on the Syrian government, although they never outright claimed responsibility</li>
                            <li>The Aleppo school massacre is important because it was a turning point in the Islamic insurgency from a series of sporadic attacks to a full-scale urban warfare between the Assad government and the Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>Starting in November 1979, the Brotherhood terror attacks on Baath party officials/targets became almost a daily occurence (mostly in Aleppo and other northern cities)</li>
                            <li>By April 1980, the Baath government responded to the increase in violence with a brutal police/military crackdown</li>
                            <li>Between 1979-1981 the Aleppo crackdowns resulted in ~2000 deaths (many civilians indiscriminatly) and 8000 arrests; Brotherhood attacks resulted in 300 Baath/Alawite deaths</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>On June 27, 1980, Hafez ordered a deadly crackdown on the Brotherhood</li>
                            <li>On the same day, this resulted in the Tadmor Prison massacre where Rifaat al-Assad's (Hafez's brother) brigade killed ~1000 Tadmur prisoners in an act of revenge against the Islamist prisoners</li>

                            <li>In April 1981, Islamic guerillas staged a failed attack on an Alawite village near Hama</li>
                            <li>In revenge, the Baath government responded by deploying military units (led again by Rifaat al-Assad) in Hama who killed between 150-350 people, chosen randomly among the male population over 14</li>
                            <li>This would become known as the 1981 Hama massacre and was the bloodiest revenge act so far in the al-Assad Islamic uprising crackdown</li>
                            <li>In February 1982, the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood and Fighting Vangurard led another uprising in Hama, calling for jihad against the Baaths and quickly took control of the city</li>
                            <li>Hafez sent Rifaat's forces into the city and called for a surrender then besieged the city for 27 days</li>
                            <li>The Baath military forces attacked indiscriminately and razed much of the city</li>
                            <li>Casualties: estimated between 5,000-30,000 civilians dead, massacre is considered the "single deadliest act" of violence perpetrated by a state upon its own population in modern Arab history</li>
                            <li>The 1982 Hama massacre marked the end of the Islamic uprising as the Brotherhood would operate in exile following it (mainly in Iran)</li>
                            <li>Assad would also continue to rely on repression rather than political tactics for the remainder of his rule.</li>

                            <li>In 1976, Israel began supporting Lebanese Christians in South Lebanon against the PLO</li>
                            <li>Israel supported the Christian Maronite Phalange party led by Bashir Gemayel, who's strategy was to provoke Israel by provoking Syria into retalitory attacks on Christians</li>
                            <li>In June 1982, Israel invaded southern Lebanon, attacking the PLO following an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to the UK by an Iraq-backed group Abu Nidal (who were actually enemies with the PLO)</li>
                            <li>At the time, Begin was the PM of Israel and publicly stated they didn't want any confrontation with Syria, only to drive out the PLO</li>
                            <li>However, the driving force behind the Israeli invasion was Ariel Sharon and one of his many reasons for invading included driving out the Syrian Army from Lebanon, who backed the PLO and who had over 30,000 troops stationed in Lebanon at the time.</li>
                            <li>Thus, the Syrian and IDF clash was inevitable and planned from the start by Sharon</li>
                            <li>One IDF division was sent to the Bekaa Valley, to (and succeeded) prevent Syrian reinforcements and prevent Syrian forces from being able to intervene in the Israeli invasion.</li>
                            <li>On June 8, 1982, the IDF and Syrian army battled in the Battle of Jezzine in central Lebanon, with the IDF winning that same day.</li>
                            <li>After the battle, Assad was convinced that the IDF wanted to fight the Syrians too, not just the PLO as they had publicly stated and sped up the deployment of Syrian forces in the Bekaa Valley</li>
                            <li>Israel saw that the Syrians were only brining forces from the Golan Heights as a sign that Syria didn't want a wider was and decided to launch an operation on Syria the next day</li>
                            <li>On June 9, 1982, Israel launched Operation Mole Cricket 19 on the Syria forces, which was one of the largest air battles since WW2 and was the first time in history that a western-equipped air force destroyed a Soviet SAM (surface to air missile) network, resulted in a dramatic victory for Israel.</li>
                            <li>On June 10, Reagan imposed on Begin and Assad to agree to a ceasefire but it fell apart.</li>
                            <li>Israeli advances deeper into Lebanon would continue to defeat the PLO and Syrian forces until June 11 there was an Israeli-Syrian ceasefire that was extended to the PLO on June 12 but it fell apart on June 13.</li>
                            <li>On June 15, Israel cut the Beirut-Damascus highway, cutting off any Syrian reinforcements and offered Syrian forces in Beirut to withdraw to the Bekaa Valley but the Syrian government refused and fighting along the highway continued from June 16-22.</li>
                            <li>On June 22, Israel launched an operation to fully capture the highway and by June 25, they had forced the Syrians to withdraw and a ceasefire was announced.</li>
                            <li>During the war, the IAF saw great success and dominated the Syrians, while tank battles were more evenly matched</li>
                            <li>In September 1982, Bachir Gemayel, the newly elected president of Lebanon and former Christian Phalangists commander, was assassinated in a bombing by a member of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (who supported "Greater Syria")</li>
                            <li>In May 1983 Lebanon and Israel agreed on an Israeli withdraw from Lebanon under the condition that Syrian troops leave but under Syrian pressure Lebanon backed out in March 1984</li>
                            <li>In January 1985, Israel began a phased withdraw from Lebanon back to a security zone in south Lebanon, they would occupy south Lebanon for the next 20 years</li>
                            <li>After the Israelis withdrew to the security zone was finished in June 1985, the Syrians gained de facto occupation of North Lebanon and Assad began to slowly re-grow his limited control over Lebanon</li>

                            <li>At the start of the 1982 Lebanon war, Assad had expelled Arafat and the Pal factions allied to Syria in Lebanon</li>
                            <li>Starting in May 1983, Syria backed the anti-Arafat PLO forces of Abu Musa in the Bekka Valley</li>    
                            <li>Assad wanted to control both the PLO and Lebanon as a whole because he was worried if Palestinians got too out of control Israel would invade again</li>
                            <li>Assad feared an Israeli invasion would cause a mass flight of Pals from Lebanon, which was a problem because they were mostly Sunni and he was Alawite</li>
                            <li>Initially, the Syrians supported Pal groups such as as-Saiqa, PFLP-GC (Syrian PFLP), and the pro-Syrian Fatah splinter Abu Musa</li>
                            <li>However, the Syrian backed groups were only strong in Syrian controlled territories, in the other part of Lebanon, Fatah, the PFLP, and the DFLP all has stronger support</li>
                            <li>In June 1983, Arafat harshly critisized the Syrian government for blocking PLO supplies and Assad responded by declaring Arafat as an person that is unacceptable to work with</li>
                            <li>In November 1983, Musa led the Fatah Infifada against the Arafat Fatah faction anf forced Arafat to flee to Tunisia by December</li>
                            <li>However, over the next two years, Arafat would quietly return to Lebanon and root himself in refugee camps in Beirut and south Lebanon</li>
                            <li>The return of Arafat drove Assad's fears of an Israeli invasion again so he formed a alliance with the Shia Amal Movement (Lebanon Resistance Regimes) militia</li>
                            <li>Pal groups in Lebanon that refused to side with the Syrians against Arafat were met with Syrian wrath, such as the Communist Action Organization in Lebanon (OCAL), who was driven underground after 1987</li>
                            <li>In May 1985, the war of the camps broke out between the various pro-Arafat militias in Lebanon against anti-Arafat militias including the Abu Musa, As-Saiqa, the PLA, and the PFLP-GC and pro-Syrian militias backed by Syria including the Lebanese Communist Party (LCP) and the Amal Movement.</li>
                            <li>The war of the camps was basically fighting between the Palestinian camp militias all over Lebanon</li>
                            <li>By the end of May 1985, the Arab League and the Soviets pressured Syria into a meeting for the issue in June and the next day Amal declared a unilateral ceasefire, however low scale fighting continued</li>
                            <li>In December 1985, the Syrians and their Lebanese allies agreed to stabilize the situation in Lebanon, this was opposed by the Phalangists</li>
                            <li>In September 1986, the fighting continued and didn't end until April 1987, after Syrian commando troops were forced in intervene again and took over positions around the camps and Beirut after being pressured by Iran</li>

                    <h2 class="title">Syrian Occupation of Lebanon</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>The occupation began in May 1976, when Syria intervened in the Lebanese Civil War; Syria sent 2,000 troops into Lebanon and the occupation was eventually legitimized by the Arab League, who allowed the Arab Deterrent Force in Lebanon as a peacekeeping force (primarily composed of Syrian troops)</li>
                            <li>During the occupation, Assad spread the idea of "Greater Syria" and took steps to integrate Lebanon into Syria</li>
                            <li>Hafez quote July 1976: "Syria and Lebanon were one state and one people... and have shared interests and a common history"</li>
                            <li>Hafez quote 1983: "Lebanon and Syria are one single people, one single nation. We may be divided into two independent states, but that does not mean that we are two different nations... I would even argue that the feeling of kinship between Syria and Lebanon runs deeper than it does between states in the United States... Soviet Union is not in Lebanon and never was present there, neither before nor after the Israeli invasion."</li>
                            <li>In 1989, the Lebanese Civil War ended and Beirut was split between the rival parties</li>
                            <li>East Beirut was controlled by Michel Aoun (anti-Syrian and military government) and West Beirut was controlled by Selim el-Hoss (supported by Syria and civilian government)</li>
                            <li>In March 1989, the "War of Liberation" was started by Aoun to rid Lebanon of the Syrians but was defeated and exiled in October 1990 after losing international support (much of Aoun's support was from Iraq, who sent aid from 1988 until Iraq was invaded in 1990)</li>
                            <li>In October 1989, the Lebanese Civil war ended with the signing of the the Syrian-sponsored Taif Agreement, which provided for a large role for Syria in Lebanese affairs including foreign policy and economic matters.</li>
                            <li>After the war ended, about 1 million Syrians went to Lebanon to find jobs and in 1994, the Lebanese government controversially granted citizenship to over 200,000 Syrians</li>
                            <li>In 1991, this paved the way for Lebanon and Syria to sign the treaty of "Brotherhood, Cooperation, and Coordination," legitimizing Syrian military presence and giving them responsibility to defend Lebanon</li>
                            <li>In October 1991, Syria launched a major operation both army and airforce, into Lebanon against Aoun in his stronghold of the presidential palace, killing hundreds of Aoun supporters and forcing Aoun into exile in Paris</li>
                            <li>The Syrian operation was only able to take place after the US convinced Israel not to interfere with Syrian forces in Beirut, in exchange for Syria helping in the Gulf War against Saddam Hussein.</li>
                            <li>The Syrian occupation of Lebanon was a proxy war between all the militias in Lebanon who were being backed by Iran (Hezbollah), the US (Syria, Israel), and the Soviets (National Movement).</li>
                            <li>Hafez was the only Arab leader to occupy another Arab country for 30 years and subjegated not only oppressed the Syrians but also the Lebanese, by trying to force a common thought and culture onto them through heavy governmental influence and pressure</li>
                            <li>The Syrian occupation was particularly disadventageous to the Maronite population, since most of their leadership was either killed, jailed, or exiled. </li>

                            <li>In January 1991, a 42 country US-led coalition began Operaion Desert Storm (aerial bombing campaign) against Iraq after Saddam invaded neighboring Kuwait in August 1990</li>
                            <li>Assad condemned the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait</li>
                            <li>In September 1990, James Baker traveled to Syria to meet with Assad</li>
                            <li>Assad personnally hated Saddam for the fact that "Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years."</li>
                            <li>After the Baker visit, Assad pledged to give 100,000 Syrian troops to the US-led coalition</li>
                            <li>This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition</li>
                            <li>In exchange, the US gave Assad the green light to wipe out anti-Syrian forces in Lebanon and arranged for $1 billion in weapons to go to Syria through other Gulf states</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In 1967 the Golan Heights came under Israeli occupation and the Israelis began settling there until in 1981, they unilaterally annexed their part of the Golan Heights</li>
                            <li>After the US victory in the Gulf War, Bush wanted to use the opportunity to revitalize the Arab-Israeli peace process in a multi-party international conference</li>
                            <li>At the Madrid Confrence in October 1991, bilateral talks were initiated between Israel and Syria and hosted by Spain with the US and USSR as co-sponsors</li>
                            <li>The negotations were split between bilateral negoations for each country present (Israel-Syria, Israel-Lebanon, Israel-Palestine), and multilateral ones focusing on major issues like water and refugees</li>
                            <li>Syria and Lebanon refused to take part in the multilateral mettings unless there was concrete progress on the bilateral ones.</li>
                            <li>Syria continued to engage in negotiations with Israel throughout the 1990s over the return of the occupied Golan Heights and possible peace accords but each one ended in failure</li>
                            <li>The last direct talks between Syria and Israel was between Hafez and Bill Clinton in March 2000</li>
                            <li>After 2000, the talks ultimately failed because of Assad's insistence on Israel's full withdrawl from the Golan Heights.</li>
                            <li>In 2008, the talks were renewed with Turkey as a mediator but fell apart after Ehud Olmert resigned as PM of Israel</li>
                            <li>Five villages of mostly Druze Arabs were offered Israeli citizenship after 1967</li>
                            <li>In 2010, the Druze became more vocal and Israel witnessed an uptick in citizenship applications while others began holding rallies loyal to Syria.</li>
                            <li>In March 2019, the US was the first country to recognize Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to the instability and history of military coups, during the 1990s the question of who would succeed Hafez was a principal domestic question</li>
                            <li>Originally, Basil al-Assad, Hafez's eldest son, was seen as the expected successor</li>
                            <li>In 1994, Basil died in a car crash and Hafez began grooming Bashar to become the next president</li>
                            <li>In 1998, Hafez's brother, Rifaat al-Assad, was "relieved of his post" as vice president</li>
                            <li>In 2000, Hafez died and Bashar succeeded him in the presidency after winning elections, he was unopposed and won 97% of the vote</li>
                            <li>Immediately after Hafez's death, the Syrian Parliament reduced the minimum age of the President from 40 to 34 to accomidate Bashar</li>
                            <li>Many had high hopes for Bashar, with domestic and international observers expecting him to have a degree of order and continuity, more political openness in Syrian society, and carry out the government reform campaign started under Hafez to root out corruption.</li>
                            <li>However, Bashar would continue to rule with an iron fist with brutal repression of political dissents and a clampdown on civil society movements, banning all public opposition</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Under Hafez, there were 5 security agencies that functioned to suppress political opposition</li>
                            <li>These included: state of emergency put in place in 1963, military courts applying martial law, special courts to try political cases, prisoners were often tortured and held in despicable conditions</li>
                            <li>However, in 1998, the level of repression diminished noticeably</li>
                            <li>After Hafez's death, in June 2000, a period of intense political and social debate started in Syria</li>
                            <li>Assad also released 600 political prisoners early in his term and improved relations with Iraq</li>
                            <li>However, the expected liberalization of Syria never came, with only economic-related measures ever being implemented and even those were slow to progress</li>
                            <li>Damascus spring began with Statement 99 by 99 Syrian intellectuals on September 2000 calling for the state of emergency to be ended, all political prisoners to be pardoned, deportees and exiles to he allowed to return, freedom of speech/assembly, and freedom from the government.</li>
                            <li>The movement consisted of various forums where groups of like minded people in oppoistion to the Baath regime met privately to discuss political matters.</li>
                            <li>In November 2000, the government responded by releasing hundreds of political prisoners and the closure of the Mezze prison</li>
                            <li>However, the Damascus Spring would come to an end in 2001, when the government returned to repression with a number of imprisonments and forced closure of forums</li>
                            <li>In May 2001, Pope John Paul II visited Damascus</li>
                            <li>In October 2005, a group of Syrian opposition figures issued the Damascus Declaration calling Assad and the government "authoritarian, totalitarian, and cliquish"</li>
                            <li>They called for a "peaceful, gradual" reform and was signed by Arab, Kurdish, and even Muslim Brotherhood figures</li>
                            <li>In 2007, amid an oppostion boycott, Assad won a second election term in office</li>
                            <li>Critics denounced the elections after Assad ran unopposed and achieved just under 100% of the vote.</li>
                            <li>In October 2008, 12 signatores of the Damascus Declaration were sentenced to 2.5 years in prison</li>

                    <h2 class="title">Syrian Withdraw from Lebanon</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>In 2000, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon and Hafez died, resulting in a strong resistance to Syrian presence from the Lebanese population</li>
                            <li>In August 2001, the first anti-Syrian demonstrations in Lebanon began and turned violent, resulting in the Lebanese-Syrian security system brutally repressing the revolt, with arrests of hundreds of people (mainly Christians) without justification.</li>
                            <li>In September 2004, UNSC resolution 1559 was adopted (coauthored by US/France) calling for free elections in Lebanon, the disarming of militias like Hezbollah, and all foreign forces (Syria) to withdraw and cease intervening in Lebanese politics.</li>

                            <li>In February 2005, Lebanese PM Rafic Hariri (anti-Syrian), was assassinated in a truck bomb attack.</li>
                            <li>The Lebanese government accused 6 Austrialian nationals of carrying out the attack but they were later absolved.</li>
                            <li>Despite non-substantial evidence for any party having carried out the attacks, the Lebanese population largely blamed Syria government and the pro-Syrian Lebanese president Emile Lahoud for the assassination.</li>
                            <li>This sparked Cedar Revolution with mass nonvoilent/peaceful protests with the goals of: (1) full Syrian withdraw from Lebanon, (2) independent leadership and parliement elections free from Syrian influence, (3) an independent commission to investigate Hariri's death</li>
                            <li>Most of the international community called for Syria to withdraw and implement UN resolution 1559</li>
                            <li>Hezbollah was against resolution 1559 and led mass pro-Syrian protests with hundreds of thousands of (mostly Shite) protesters.</li>
                            <li>Daily protests says large getherings of over 25,000 people and, unlike the 1990s anti-Syrian demonstrations, were not met with force from the government.</li>
                            <li>On February 28 2005, the pro-Syrian government under PM Omar Karami resigned and called for new elections. </li>
                            
                            <li>In April 2005, all Syrian occupation forces had completed the full withdrawl from Lebanon and implemented resolution 1559, due to the Cedar Revolution</li>
                            <li>Also in April 2005, a general election was held, and the Special Tribunal for Lebanon was created to investigate Hariri's death; achieving all the main goals of the revolution</li>
                            <li>In October 2008, Syria and Lebanon established dimplomatic relations and opened embassies for the first time in history.</li>

                    <h2 class="title">Relations with Turkey</h2>
                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Turkey has always been a foe of Iran, Iraq and Syria due to their secular democracy and close relations with the EU/US</li>
                            <li>Syria and Turkey had traditionally had sour relations due to the self-annexation of the Hatay Province (Alexandretta) in 1939, water diputes from dams built on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers during the Southeastern Anatolia Project, and Syrian support for the Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK)</li>
                            <li>Syria and Turkey came to the brink of war after Turkey threatened military action if Syrian didn't stop sheltering Abdullah Ocalan in Damascus, which was his long time safe-haven</li>

                            <li>In 1978, Ocalan founded the PKK in Turkey and in 1979, he departed from Turkey for Syria after establishing connections with militant Pal orgs</li>
                            <li>In the early 1980s, the PKK spread further into Iraq and in 1984 launched an armed resistance against Turkey from Iraq that would turn into an all-out war</li>
                            <li>In October 1998, relations with Turkey improved somewhat when the leader of the PKK, Abdullah Ocalan, was expelled by Syrian authorities</li>



                            <li>In Janurary 2004, Bashar was the first Syrian president to visit Ankara and later in 2004 Erdogan came to Damascus to sign a joint free trade agreement</li>
                            <li>In April 2007, Assad and Erdogan met again at the ceremony of hte Aleppo International Stadium and in 2005 Turkish President Sezer visited Damascus during the Cedar Revolution</li>
                            <li>In 2008, Turkey was invited to mediate talks between Irael and Syria over the Golan Heights, the talks ended up failing</li>
                            <li>In April 2009, Turkey and Syrian had an unprecedented three-day military exercise along their shared border</li>
                            <li>However, after the Syrian Civil War broke out, relations were strained again and diplomatic contact was suspended in March 2012</li>
                            <li>In June 2012, a Turkish military training flight was downed by Syrian forces resulting in Turkey calling an emergency NATO meeting.</li>


                            <li>After the power vacuum was formed during the Syrian Civil War, in 2015, the PKK took large swaths of territory in northeastern Syria</li>
                            <li>In July 2016, a failed coup attempt in Turkey led to government crackdowns, including against the PKK</li>
                            <li>In August 2016, Turkey launched an offensive into northwestern Syria to prevent the PKK from expanding into western Syria or launching cross-border attacks.</li>

                    <div class="content">
                        <ul>
                            <li>Leading up to the Arab Spring, Syria was considered the most restrictive police state in the Arab World</li>
                            <li>This included more than 400 travel bans on individuals that were political opponents to Assad, aresting of journalists, and tightening of internet censorship</li>
                            <li>Social discontent was also caused by the US invasion of Iraq, the most intense drought ever recorded in the region, and widespread corruption (nepotism and bribery) within the Baathist government</li>
                            <li>The protesters demanded the end of the state of emergency, more freedoms, and an end to pervasive government corruption</li>
                            <li>In March 2011, as part of the larger Arab Spring, popular discontent within the Baathist government led to large scale pro-democracy/anti-Assad rallies and protests accross Syria</li>
                            <li>The protests originated on March 6 2011 in Daraa following the detainment of 15 young students who were spray painting anti-government graffiti</li>
                            <li>The Daraa protests quickly spread and they eventually burned down the Baath party headquarters and other buildings, with security forces responding by firing live ammunition at crowds</li>
                            <li>By late March 2011, the protests had spread to Damascus, al-Hasakah, Deir az-Zor, Hama, Homs, Aleppo, and Latakia</li>
                            <li>However, the Syrian Revolution protests were violently suppressed by the Assad regime and tens of thousands of deaths and detentions occured following an official "shoot to kill" policy by the government, deploying snipers/heavy machine guns/shelling</li>
                            <li>Assad also imposed a complete media blackout, banning independent news coverage and banning any foreign press</li>
                            <li>Mass defections occured after security forces who disagreed with the government policy against the demonstrations were themselves fired upon by the Baathist paramilitaries and Shabiha death squads (Alawite loyalists executioners)</li>
                            <li>In April 2011, the Baath regime announced concessions such as political reforms and policy changes as well has a lift of the state of emergency (used for arbitrary arrests and political supression), but the protests continued</li>
                            <li>After the failed concessions, in late April 2011 Assad deployed the Syrian Army and Shabiha mercenaries on the protesters using tanks and live ammunition to unleash violence on the civilians, who continued to demonstrate in larger and larger protests</li>
                            <li>In July 2011, the early insurgency phase of the Syrian civil war began with the formation of the FSA</li>
                            <li>From August 2011 to June 2012, anti-government demonstrations continued and were met with repression</li>
                            <li>In June 2012, the revolution had transformed into a full-blown civil war</li>
                            <li>Between 2011 and 2012, more than 60,000 Syrian civilians had been killed by the Syrian military forces</li>

                            <li>After the failed concessions and repressions by Assad in April 2011, the anti-government demonstrations continued and were met with further repression</li>
                            <li>In July 2011, the Free Syrian Army (FSA) was formed by 7 defected Syrian Army officers and composed of defected soldiers, marking the beginning of armed insurgency against the Syrian Arab Republic</li>
                            <li>The FSA's stated goal was to bring down the Assad government</li>
                            <li>In August 2011, Syrian opposition factions and dissidents formed an anti-Assad coalition called the Syrian National Council and political branch of the FSA based in Turkey</li>
                            <li>In October 2011, the FSA began recieving active support from the Turkish government</li>
                            <li>Later in October 2011, there were massive pro-Assad rallies with over an estimated million demostrators</li>

                            <li>In April 2012, Assad began deploying attack helicopters against the rebels</li>
                            <li>Later in April 2012, a UN backed ceasefire was declared but quickly failed.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Due to the Syrian FSA insurgency raging on for over a year, the Arab League and the UN moved to form a peace plan</li>
                            <li>In February 2012, the Arab League and the UN appointed Kofi Annan as their special envoy to Syria</li>
                            <li>In March 2012, Kofi submitted a 6 point peace plan to the UNSC and in late March, it was announced that Assad had accpeted the peace plan</li>
                            <li>In early April, "both parties appeared to be observing the ceasefire" but shelling started again in late April 2012 and by May 2012, both the FSA and the Syrian government were violating the ceasefire</li>
                            <li>On 25 May 2012, the Houla massacre took place, where 108 people were summarily executed, resulting in the FSA ultimatum to the Baath government and calling the ceasefire "dead" as they began mounting a nationwide offensive on the government troops</li>
                            <li>By June 2012, the Kofi peace initiative had fully fallen apart, with both sides openly engaging in violence again</li>
                            <li>Also in June 2012, Assad vowed to crush the anti-government uprisings and shortly after fighting broke out in Latakia</li>
                            <li>On 12 June 2012, the UN for the first time officially proclaimed Syria to be in a state of civil war</li>
                            <li>Later in June 2012, peaceful protests spread to Aleppo and Damascus and then a Turkish fighter jet was shot down by the Syrian government killing both pilots and forcing Assad to apologise.</li>
                            <li>In July 2012, the Syrian Government took parts of Homs, Idlib and Damascus and fighting intensified in Aleppo, where Syrian government forces used fighter jets on the rebels</li>
                            <li>In September 2012, the Syrian Army killed 21 Kurds in Aleppo, causing the Kurdish YPG to retaliate against the Syrian Army</li>
                            <li>Also in September 2012, the FSA siezed a border crossing in Raqqa between Syria and Turkey, who was supporting the rebels</li>

                            <li>In late October 2012, Lakhdar Brahimi (Kofi replacement) arranged a ceasefire that quickly fell apart</li>
                            <li>After the ceasefire fell, the Syrian Army moved on Damascus and the rebels made gains in Idlib, Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor</li>
                            <li>In December 2012, the Syrian Army began using Scud missiles on the rebels but the rebels still made gains in Damascus and Idlib and launched an offensive in Homs</li>
                            <li>In Jan-Feb 2013, the rebels made gains in Idlib, Raqqa, Aleppo, and Al-Hasakah, the Syrian Army also began shelling Hezbollah targets, and the Syrian Army engaged in fighting with the Kurdish YPG</li>
                            <li>In March 2013, the rebels captured Raqqa city, which was first provincial capital to fall and the Syrian Army first started shelling rebel targets in Lebanon</li>
                            <li>From April-June 2013, the Syrian Government forces, with the help of Hezbollah, launched an offensive and retook territory around Damascus, Idlib, Homs, Daara</li>
                            <li>From July-October 2013, fighting continued with increased activity from ISIS and other jihadist groups (FSA formally declared war on ISIS in June 2013) as well as the YPG and other Kurdish groups and with the FSA and Syrian Army trading territories in a stalemate</li>
                            <li>In August 2013, the Syrian Army used a chemical attack near Damascus leading to hundreds of deaths</li>
                            <li>From Oct-Dec 2013, the Syrian Army with allies Hezbollah and the al-Abas brigade, lauched an offensive on Damascus and Aleppo and recaptured territories in both regions</li>
                            <li>In November 2013, the Islamic rebels took the al-Omar oil field (largest in Syria) forcing the government to almost entirely rely on imported oil</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>In 2013, the FSA and ISIL cooperated somewhat with only small clashes but then a full-out conflict began to break out in January 2014 when ISIL forces attacked the rebel held town of Atarib in Aleppo</li>
                            <li>In the first week of fighting, the rebels (Islamic Frons, al-Nusra, Ahrar ash-Sham) made large gains against ISIL in Aleppo, Raqqa, Dier ez-Zor, and Aleppo</li>
                            <li>In the second week, ISIL and Islamic Front signed a truce deal in Al-Hasakah and ISIL captured almost all of Raqqa (against al-Nusra) while ISIL and the rebels were in a stalemate in Aleppo</li>
                            <li>During this time, ISIL used suicide bombing attacks, car bombing attacks, and mass executed prisoners they had taken</li>
                            <li>For the rest of the first month, ISIL continued to take some territory but took multiple loses among seniro commanders</li>
                            <li>In February 2014, ISIL attacked the al-Tawhid Brigade (Islamist group) in Aleppo, causing al-Qaeda to break links with ISIL and distance themselves from the group</li>
                            <li>Also in Feb 2014, the Raqqa Revolutionaries Brigade (Islamic group) launched an offensive on ISIL in Raqqa, al-Nusra also launched an offensive on ISIL in Deir ez-Zor and had taken most of the province back within a few days</li>
                            <li>In mid-Feb 2014, the Kurdish Front, the Northern Storm Brigade, and Descendants of Messengers Brigade (FSA affiliated) led an offensive in Northern Aleppo on ISIL</li>
                            <li>In late Feb 2014, ISIL withdrew from the major northern Aleppo city Azaz, with the Northern Storm Brigade and al-Tawhid Brigade taking control</li>
                            <li>In March 2014, ISIL retreated from Idlib and Latakia but took the Al-Hasakah town of Markada in the Battle of Markada</li>
