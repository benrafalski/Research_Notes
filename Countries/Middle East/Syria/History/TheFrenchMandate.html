    <h2>The French Mandate</h2>
    <h3>Sykes-Picot Agreement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Between 1915-16, the Hussein-McMahon correspondence informally promised an Arab state to in exchange for help against the Ottomans in WWI</li>
        <li>However, in May 1916, the secret Sykes-Picot agreement was made between France, the British, and Russia</li>
        <li>At the time, France had economic intrests in Syria and Britain wanted control of the Suez Canal to access India</li>
        <li>The agreement outlined the disolution of the Ottoman empire where Russia would get Armenian territory, France would get Lebanese/Syrian/Iraqi territory, Britain would get Iraqi/Israeli territory and Palestine would be internationally controlled</li>
        <li>Russia eventually defected from WWI and their side of the deal was cancelled</li>
        <li>After WWI ended Allenby installed Faisal as king of Damascus</li>
        <li>France took over Lebanon and Britain took Palestine, the fate of Syria remained undecided among the Allies</li>
        <li>Once light of the Sykes-Picot agreement reached the Arabs, civil unrest errupted in Syria</li>
        <li>In June 1920, the French made an ultimatum to Syria to recognize the French mandate</li>
        <li>The unrest in Syria continued and France responded with a military occupation and exiled Faisal from the country in July</li>
