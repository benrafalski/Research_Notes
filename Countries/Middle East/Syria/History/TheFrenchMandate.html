    <h2>The French Mandate</h2>
    <h3>Sykes-Picot Agreement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Between 1915-16, the Hussein-McMahon correspondence informally promised an Arab state to in exchange for help against the Ottomans in WWI</li>
        <li>However, in May 1916, the secret Sykes-Picot agreement was made between France, the British, and Russia</li>
        <li>At the time, France had economic intrests in Syria and Britain wanted control of the Suez Canal to access India</li>
        <li>The agreement outlined the disolution of the Ottoman empire where Russia would get Armenian territory, France would get Lebanese/Syrian/Iraqi territory, Britain would get Iraqi/Israeli territory and Palestine would be internationally controlled</li>
        <li>Russia eventually defected from WWI and their side of the deal was cancelled</li>
        <li>After WWI ended Allenby installed Faisal as king of Damascus</li>
        <li>France took over Lebanon and Britain took Palestine, the fate of Syria remained undecided among the Allies</li>
        <li>Once light of the Sykes-Picot agreement reached the Arabs, civil unrest errupted in Syria</li>
        <li>In April 1919, the King-Crane Commission from the US recommended that the mandate system be led by the League of Nations, rather than France and Britain, due to local sentiment in the Middle East</li>
        <li>However, in August 1919, Woodrow Wilson abandoned the King-Crane Commission's findings due to opposition from the Senate for violating US isolationist policy</li>
        <li>In June 1920, the French General Gouraud made an ultimatum to Syria to recognize the French mandate, known as the Gouraud ultimatum</li>
        <li>King Faisal and the Syrian government accepted but the Minsiter of Defense, Yusuf al-Azma, held out and gathered the remains of the Syrian army to fight the French army</li>
        <li>This resulted in unrest breaking out in Syria and France responded with a military occupation and exiled Faisal from the country in July 1920 after Yusuf al-Azma was killed in battle</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>Conference of San Remo</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In November 1918, the French and British declared their intention to establish control over Syria and Iraq</li>
        <li>In March 1920, a Syrian Congress met, declaring Faisal king of Greater Syria which included Syria and Palestine</li>
        <li>However, in April 1920, Great Britain, France, Italy, Japan, Greece, and Belgium met at the Confrence of San Remo to decide the fate of the Ottoman Empire's territories following their defeat in WWI</li>
        <li>At the San Remo confrence the framework for the Treaty of Sevres was decided upon and created two 'A' mandates</li>
        <li>Under the mandates, France would control Lebanon and Syria (French Mandate) and Palestine/Mesopotamia (Iraq)/Transjordan was controlled by the British (British mandate)</li>
        <li>Under "A" mandates, the regions were independent but subject to their respective mandatory power</li>
        <li>In August 1920, the Treaty of Sevres was signed by Turkey and abolished the Ottoman Empire, renouncing all control over Arab Asia and North Africa</li>
        <li>Also in August 1920, Lebanon was declared a separate autonomous state from Syria</li>
        <li>In July 1920, Faisal was expelled by the French army from Syria after opposing the French mandate</li>
        <li>In July 1922, the League of Nations officially approved the French mandate for Syria and Lebanon</li>
        <li>At this point, Syria was geographically referred to the land left after Lebanon, Transjordan, and Palestine were detached from it</li>
    </ul>
