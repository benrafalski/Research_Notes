    <h2>Baathist Syria</h2>
    <h3>Baathist 1963 Coup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Baathists party is a pan-Arabist party who advocate for a single Arab socialist nation</li>
        <li>The party was highly authoritarian and centralized and was founded in 1943 in Damascus</li>
        <li>The Baathists attracted both the middle class and religious minorities of lower classes like the Alawites, Druze, and Ismailis</li>
        <li>The Baathist began to gain popularity during the Colonel period when the military started playing a larger role in Syrian politics</li>
        <li>The modern Baathist Party was formed in 1953 in the merger of the Arab Baath Party and the Arab Socialist Party</li>
        <li>In February 1963, the Baathists in Iraq seized control over their country</li>
        <li>In March 1963, the Baathists in Syria, inspired by the Iraqi Baathists, led a coup and seized control of Syria themselves</li>
        <li>The coup was planned and led by the military faction of the Baathists, rather than the civilain one who was initially against the plan, but the civilian faction (led by Michel Aflaq) still signed off on it because the civilain branch and military branch both needed each other for political survival</li>
        <li>After the coup, Muhammad Umran, Salah Jadid, and Hafez al-Assad (all Alawites and all part of the Baathist military branch) took power, since they were the ones that led the coup</li>
        <li>The 1963 coup was the end of democracy in Syria, as the uniparty Baathists state that would emerge would become totalitarian</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Baathist meet with Nasser</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the Baathists took control of Iraq and Syria they began planning for a union</li>
        <li>They created the National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC) that was made up of both Syria Baathist (military and civilian) and Syrian Nassersists</li>
        <li>However, there was still pro-Nasser parties in both countries who rejected this</li>
        <li>In 1963, the Baathists from Syria and Iraq flew to Cairo for talks with Nasser</li>
        <li>In April 1963, they agreed on a three state union between Egypt, Syria, and Iraq with Nasser as President</li>
        <li>However, the Baathists would renounce the agreement two weeks later and pro-Nasser unionists were purged from Syria, cementing the Baathist's full control over the country and establishing loyal Alawites as military officers (Sunnis were stripped)</li>
        <li>In June 1963, the remaining Nasserist, led by Jassem Alwan, in the military staged a coup on the Baathists but failed and were all arrested and executed</li>
        <li>The failed coup marked the end of Nasserist influence in the military and Syrian politics, however Nasser remained popular among the Syrian population</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1966 Coup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the 1963 takeover, the Alawite military officers controlled the Baathist party and crushed all domestic opposition with a police state</li>
        <li>There were some Nasserists appointed to high government positions but the Baathist were the ones who controlled power, since they were weak in Syrian popularity</li>
        <li>The Baathists appealed to the lower and middle classes who resented powerful policitians and landowners</li>
        <li>In February 1966, Col. Salah al-Jadid led a military coup after the Baathists party began to fracture between civilian and military due to internal rivalries</li>
        <li>In the lead up to the coup, the old guard (or National Command led by Michel Aflaq) and radical Neo-Baathist leftists engaged in a power struggle</li>
        <li>The supporters of the old guard in the military ordered the transfer of the radical leftists on Feburary 21 and caused the Military Committee to lauch the coup to days later in support of the radical leftists neo-Baathists</li>
        <li>After the coup, the National Command was removed from power and replaced by a union between the Military Committee and the Regional Command</li>
        <li>The Military Committee was led by Jadid, who began purging the government and converted the party into a radical militarist neo-Baathist organization that was independent of the National Command of the original Baathists party</li>
        <li>By 1969, the Baathists party was split between the civilian wing led by Jadid and the military wing led by Gen. Hafez al-Assad (commander of the air force)</li>
        <li>Jadid was chief of staff of the armed forces</li>
        <li>Progressives: civilians led by Jadid</li>
        <li>Nationalists: military led by Assad</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Syrian-Iraqi split</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Following the 1966 coup, Iraq and Syrian Baathists would split from one another, forming a schism</li>
        <li>In 1963, the Syrian Baathists realized that they were being subordinated in the Pan-Arab central committe</li>
        <li>This allowed for non-Syrian Baathists to have a say in Syrian affairs</li>
        <li>This resulted in the Syrian Baathists establishing thier own Pan-Arab central committee, creating a rivalry between the Iraqi Baathists and the Syrian Baathists where each claimed to be the real leader of the Pan-Arab national movement</li>
        <li>Each still had to contend with internal threats including the Muslim Brotherhood for the Syrians and the Kurds and Shias in Iraq</li>
    </ul>
