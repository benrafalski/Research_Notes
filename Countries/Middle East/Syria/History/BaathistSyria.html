    <h2>Baathist Syria</h2>
    <h3>Baathist 1963 Coup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Baathists party is a pan-Arabist party who advocate for a single Arab socialist nation</li>
        <li>The party was highly authoritarian and centralized and was founded in 1943 in Damascus</li>
        <li>In February 1963, the Baathists in Iraq seized control over their country</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Baathist meet with Nasser</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the Baathists took control of Iraq and Syria they began planning for a union</li>
        <li>However, there was still pro-Nasser parties in both countries who rejected this</li>
        <li>In 1963, the Baathists from Syria and Iraq flew to Cairo for talks with Nasser</li>
        <li>However, the talks failed and pro-Nasser unionists were expelled from Syria, cementing the Baathist's full control over the country</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Syrian-Iraqi split</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1963, the Syrian Baathists realized that they were being subordinated in the Pan-Arab central committe</li>
        <li>This allowed for non-Syrian Baathists to have a say in Syrian affairs</li>
        <li>This resulted in the Syrian Baathists establishing thier own Pan-Arab central committee, creating a rivalry between the Iraqi Baathists and the Syrian Baathists where each claimed to be the real leader of the Pan-Arab national movement</li>
        <li>Each still had to contend with internal threats including the Muslim Brotherhood for the Syrians and the Kurds and Shias in Iraq</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1966 Coup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the 1963 takeover, Alawite military officers controlled the Baathist party and crushed all domestic opposition with a police state</li>
        <li>The Baathists appealed to the lower and middle classes who resented powerful policitians and landowners</li>
        <li>In February 1966, Col. Salah al-Jadid led a military coup after the Baathists party began to fracture due to internal rivalries</li>
        <li>By 1969, the Baathists party was split between the civilian wing led by Jadid and the military wing led by Gen. Hafez al-Assad (commander of the air force)</li>
        <li>Jadid was chief of staff of the armed forces</li>
        <li>Progressives: civilians led by Jadid</li>
        <li>Nationalists: military led by Assad</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assad Regime</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the 1966 coup, Assad became minister of defense</li>
        <li>In 1967, he was dealt a blow when Israel took the Golan Heights from them in the six day war</li>
        <li>In November 1970, Assad engaged in a power struggle with Jadid and finally siezed control of the government when be became prime minister</li>
        <li>In March 1971, he was sworn in as president</li>
