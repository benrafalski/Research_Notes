    <h3>Syrian-Iraqi split</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1963, the Syrian Baathists realized that they were being subordinated in the Pan-Arab central committe</li>
        <li>This allowed for non-Syrian Baathists to have a say in Syrian affairs</li>
        <li>This resulted in the Syrian Baathists establishing thier own Pan-Arab central committee, creating a rivalry between the Iraqi Baathists and the Syrian Baathists where each claimed to be the real leader of the Pan-Arab national movement</li>
        <li></li>
