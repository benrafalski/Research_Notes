    <h2>Hafez al-Assad Regime</h2>
    <h3>Black September</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1966, the As-Saiqa orgamization was formed by the Syrian Baath Party and in December 1968 became the second largest group within the PLO behind Arafat's Fatah</li>
        <li>Starting in March 1968, Syria and Iraq had begun training thousands of Palestinian fedayeen guerillas in Jordan</li>
        <li>Armed conflict between the Jordan king King Hussein and the PLO led by Arafat starting in September 1970</li>
        <li>On September 18, 1970, Syria intervened with 10,000 Syrian troops with Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) markings invaded Jordan</li>
        <li>By September 22, the Syrian forces withdrew due to suffering heavy losses to the Jordanian forces</li>
        <li>The power struggle between Jadid (leading the ground forces) and Assad (air force) has been attributed to the Syrian failure in Jordan</li>
        <li>In October 1970 a agreement was signed between Jordan and the PLO but Jordan attacked again in January 1971 and forced the Palestinian fedayeen to flee through Syria to Lebanon</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Corrective Movement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>By 1969, the neo-Baathist regime was split between a civilian wing led by Jadid and a military wing led by Assad</li>
        <li>Assad appealed to the Aflaqites directly and recruited them to build his power over the larger Jadid faction in the Baathist government</li>
        <li>After Syria failed in their intervention in the Black September crisis in Jordan, Assad began planning to overthrow Jadid</li>
        <li>In November 1970, Assad seized power in a bloodless coup</li>
        <li>On November 12, the National Congress was broken up and Assad had Jadid and his associated arrested</li>
        <li>Assad also purged all As-Saiqa leaders from the Baathist government</li>
        <li>On November 13, Assad proclaimed leadership over Syria</li>
        <li>After taking power, Assad ended the Jadid era doctrine of exporting revolutions and shifted to an emphasis on defeating Israel with the help of the Soviet Union and shifting toward a "nationalist socialist" ideology</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1971 Purges</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Later in 1971, Assad shifted to viewing the Aflaqites in the government as a threat to his power and conducted a showtrial on Michel Aflaq and former Syrian President Amin al-Hafiz</li>
        <li>Both Aflaq and Hafiz were sentenced to death and Assad also purged 99 other party members by imprisoning them</li>
        <li>This purge completely wiped the Aflaq influence from the Syrian Baath party</li>
        <li>The constitution only allowed for Sunnis to become president so Assad faked being a Sunni by praying in Sunni mosques even though he was Alawite to gain the support of the ulama</li>
        <li>He also appointed many Sunnis to high ranking positions in the Baathist government</li>
        <li>In March 1971, Assad was sworn in as president</li>
        <li>Assad had consolidated his power over Syria and Alawites began to occupy coveted positions in all Syrian sectors</li>

    </ul>
    <h3>1973 Syrian Constitution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The 1973 consistution reinforced the the leading role of the Baathist Party in Syria and transformed the revolutionary state into a Presidential Monarchy in which all power was consalidated under the Syrian President (Assad) in a one-party (Baathist) socialist state</li>
        <li>Under the new consitution, the President had to be Muslim and served for 7-year terms with no term limits and was nominated by the Baath Party and approved by parliament</li>
        <li>The consitution also emphasized pan-Arab ideology and positioned Syria as one region in the wider Arab nation and calls out the need to protect against imperialism and Zionism</li>
        <li>This gave Assad full control over the military, party, and bureaucracy</li>
        <li>Assad further strengthened his power by assigning Alawite loyalists to high ranking poisitions in varuious state institutions</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assad Rule</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The authoritarian regime under Assad gained popularity due to their polices of economic development, land reform, promotion of education, strengthening of the military, and vehement opposition to Israel.</li>
        <li>Assad reverted the radical socialist policies of the Jadid regime and strengthened privatization in the economy after taking over in 1971, despite the 1973 consitution only allowing for public, collective and individual property</li>
        <li>Assads foreign policy consisted of strengthening relations with the Soviets to develop the Syrian economy/military, normalizing relations with Egypt/Saudi Arabia to establish a "Cairo-Damascus-Riyadh axis" against Israel</li>
        <li>Due to this and harsh repression of anti-Baathist opponents, the Assad government saw large stability in Syria with the alliance of the Baath Party, the military, and the bureaucracy (which was led by Assad and supported by and Alawite network of officials and officers)</li>
        <li>The majority Sunni population outside of Damascus and in merchant groups harbored opponents of the Baathist-Alawite government</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Yom Kippur War</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Islamic Uprising</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1982 Hama Massacre</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1982, the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood led an uprising in Hama</li>
        <li>The Baathists responded with suppression and destroyed the city</li>
        <li>Casualties: estimated between 5,000-10,000 civilians dead</li>
    </ul>
