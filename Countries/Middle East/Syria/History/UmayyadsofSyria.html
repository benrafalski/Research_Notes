    <h2>Umayyads of Syria</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After Muawiyah won the civil war, he established the Umayyad dynasty in Syria</li>
        <li>The Umayyad dynasty was based in Syria and their army was mainly Arab and Syrians</li>
        <li>They continued their conquests and took Asia minor (Turkey) and Constantinople from the Byzantines</li>
        <li>They also took Khorasan and Turkistan and northwestern India</li>
        <li>They also spread accross Africa all the way to Spain</li>
        <li>Over the course of Umayyad rule, Syria developed an Arab Muslim character</li>
        <li>They built the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem and the Great Mosque of Damascus</li>
        <li>Under the Umayyads, Islamic culture began to flourish</li>
        <li>However, Christian culture also remained strong, especially under Umar II</li>
        <li>In 680, at the Battle of Karbala, the Umayyad caliph Yazid I (son of Muawiyah) led an army to defeat and massacre an army led by al-Husayn ibn Ali (son of Ali and grandson of Muhammad)</li>
        <li>However, support for the the family of Ali remained strong</li>
        <li>In 717, the Umayyads began to decline, following the defeat of the Syrian army by the Byzantine emperor Leo III</li>
        <li>The Umayyads were split between two ruling parties: the Arabs of Iraq who disliked the Syrian rulers</li>
        <li>There was also the feud between the mawali (non-Arab Islamic converts) and the Umayyad Arabs</li>
        <li>In 745-746, with the rise of discontent, major revolts began to erupt in Syria, Iraq, and Khorasan</li>
        <li>The mawali then became involved with the Hashimiyyah, a political faction against Umayyad rule</li>
        <li>Finally, in 749, the Hashimiyyah and the western provinces overthrew the Umayyad caliph </li>
        <li>In 750, this established the Abbasid dynasty with the first ruler Abu al-Abbas al-Saffah</li>
        <li>Abu al-Abbas then led a campaign of extermination on the Umayyads and established Abbasid rule in Baghdad</li>
