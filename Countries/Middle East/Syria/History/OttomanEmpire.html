    <h2>Ottoman Empire</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>During the 1400s, the Mamluks continued to fall into decline</li>
        <li>At the same time, a new power was forming, the Ottoman Turks, who had taken over the Balkans and Asis Minor (Turkey)</li>
        <li>By 1516, the Ottoman sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluks and by 1517 he captured all of Syria and Egypt</li>
        <li>Under Ottoman rule, Syria was split into provinces: Damascus, Aleppo, Tripoli, and Sidon. </li>
        <li>Each province was ruled by a governor</li>
        <li>Damascus served as a special province for the organization of the pilgrimage to Mecca each year</li>
        <li>Taxation: the Ottomans used a Muslim law taxes including a land tax (kharaj), a poll tax (jizyah) on Christians and Jews, and customs taxes </li>
        <li>However, the Ottomans allowed for one to be exempt from kharaj as long as they served in the military</li>
        <li>Over time, the Ottoman taxation system fell into decline and tax collection was turned to tax farmers (multezim), who effectively became the landowning class</li>
        <li>Muslim judges/preachers, served as the interface between the government and the subjects in Ottoman society</li>
        <li>Under Ottoman administration, local communities regulated their own lives</li>
        <li>Most groups including the Bedouin tribes, Alawites, Ismailis were generally not interferred with if they paid taxes</li>
        <li>However, south of Damascus, a Druze community formed who refused to pay taxes to the Ottomans</li>
        <li>The Ottoman ulama was mostly made up of members of local religious families and were the leaders of the Muslim community</li>
    </ul>
