    <h2>Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence</h2>
    <h3>Dissolution of Contituent Assembly</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1928, the first Syrian Contituent Assembly was formed</li>
        <li>In May 1930, the high commisioner dissolved the Contituent Assembly</li>
        <li>He also enacted the Syrian nationalist proposed contitution with certain changes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Franco-Syrian treaty negotiations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>From 1930-1936, Syrian-French negotiations were unfruitful</li>
        <li>However, in September 1936 they were finally able to strike a deal, signing the Franco-Syrian treaty, due to the Popular Front government in France</li>
        <li>The treaty gave Syria independence, Franco-Syrian consultation and foreign policy, and two French military bases in Syria</li>
        <li>The Druze and Alawite states joined with the Syrian state to become one big state, Lebanon was not included</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>National Bloc</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Natioal Bloc was formed in 1925 and was insturmental in drawing up the Syrian contitution rejected by the High Commissioner</li>
        <li>After the Assembly was dissolved in 1930, the National Bloc gained in popularity  and forced the French to come to the table for negotiaitons in 1933</li>
        <li>After unfruitful negotiaitons in starting in 1933, by 1936 the National Bloc was successfull in getting the Franco-Syrian Treaty assuring Syrian independence</li>
        <li>Thus, after the Syrian ratification of the treaty in late 1936, the National Bloc became the ruling party in Parliament</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>First Syrian Parliament</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the treaty was signed, the first Syrian Parliament was elected and Natioal Bloc leader Hashim al-Atasi became president</li>
        <li>al-Atasi had been a policitian since the Ottoman era, was a member of the Syrian Congress in the early 1920s, was the president of the Contituent Assembly until it was dissolved in 1930, and was insturmental in the Franco-Syrian Treaty negotiations in Paris</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Alexandretta Turkey claims</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>At the end of 1936 the Syrians ratified the treaty but the French never did</li>
        <li>Turkey then made claims to Alexandretta and the French gave it to them in 1937 since they never signed the treaty</li>
        <li>In 1939, it was officially incorporated into Turkey</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Constitution suspended</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In February 1939, the Bloc was forced to resign due to allowing Alexandretta to become part of Turkey, failing to get the French to ratify the 1936 treaty, and antagonizing the Druze and Alawites</li>
        <li>The Bloc would return to prominence in 1941 with the independence movement and remain a majority until 1949</li>
        <li>In July 1939, the contitution was suspended when it became clear that the French were not going to ratify the treaty</li>
    </ul>
