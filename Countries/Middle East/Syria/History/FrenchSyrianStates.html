    <h2>French Syrian States</h2>
    <h3>French mandate</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Under the French Mandate, France was responsible for creating an controlling a government</li>
        <li>They were to develop the government and the country until it was ready for independence and self-government</li>
        <li>The French helped to develop roads, plan towns, encourage agriculture, and create schools (such as the University of Damascus)</li>
        <li>Thus, they set local governments: an Alawite state, a Druze state, and a Syrian state (with capital of Damascus)</li>
        <li>However, the French faces difficulties in preparing Syria for self-government because they wanted long term control of Syria and didn't want to betray the local Christians by giving Syria away to the Muslims</li>
        <li>Thus, the minorities in Syria wanted the French to stay and construct a modern government while the majority (educated elites mainly) wanted Syrian independence and for it to include Lebanon, Palestine, and Transjordan</li>
