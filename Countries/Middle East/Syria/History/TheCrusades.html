    <h2>The Crusades</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Crusades was a military expedition by the European Christans in the Middle East</li>
        <li>They were a response to the centuries of Muslim wars of expansion</li>
        <li>The Crusader's goal was to halt the spread of Islam and retake the Holy Land in the eastern Mediterranean coast</li>
        <li>After the expansion of Islam, Christanity had been driven from Palestine, Syria, Egypt, and Anatolia </li>
        <li>In 1095, the first Crusade began and resulted in the founding of a Christian state in Palestine and Syria</li>
        <li>The Crusaders then split their conquested land into four states, with the king of Jerusalem as administrator</li>
        <li>By 1128, the Turkish Muslim ruler of Mosul, Zangi, recovered Aleppo from the Crusaders</li>
        <li>In 1144, he also reclaimed Edessa (southern Turkey) too</li>
        <li>In 1154, his son, Nur al-Din, would reclaim all of Damascus and later all of Syria</li>
        <li>After Nur al-Din died, Saladin took over rule, ended the Fatimid caliphate, and founded the Ayyubid dynasty</li>
        <li>In 1187, Saladin defended against the Crusaders in the Battle of Hattin and resulted in the Muslim reconquest of Jerusalem and all of Palestine</li>
        <li>In 1189, the Christains mounted the third Crusades and briefly reclaimed part of the Mediterranean coast</li>
        <li>However, the Crusaders failed in their goal to retake Jerusalem</li>
    </ul>
