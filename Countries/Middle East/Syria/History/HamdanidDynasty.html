    <h2>Hamdanid Dynasty</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hamdan ibn Hamdun rose to political prominence in his uprisings against the Abbasid caliphate</li>
        <li>However, his sons would later serve as Abbasid officials</li>
        <li>On son, Abu al-Hayja Abd Allah initiated Hamdanid leadership when he became governor of Mosul in 905</li>
        <li>The dynasty became independent under Abd Allah's son, Nasir ad-Dawlah al-Hasan in 929</li>
        <li>This is when the dynasty expanded westward from Iraq into northern Syria</li>
        <li>In 945, Allepo and Homs were captured by Sayf ad-Dawlah</li>
        <li>ad-Dawlah spent the rest of his rule battling the Byzantine Greeks and eventually lost Antioch in 969</li>
        <li>In 979, the Hamdanids would be eventually driven from Mosul and their power shifted fully to northern Syria</li>
        <li>Over the next few decades the Hamdanids would battle with their neighbors for control of Syria</li>
        <li>Finally in 1002, control of Aleppo passed to a slave general Lulu before passing to the Fatimids</li>
        <li>During Hamdanid rule, poetry and philosiphy flourished</li>
    </ul>
