    <h2>Fatimid caliphs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 935, the Ikhshidid dynasty was formed in Egypt and southern Syria but was short lived</li>
        <li>By 969, the Fatimid dynasty from Cairo set out to expand west</li>
        <li>Under the Fatimid caliph al-Muizz, the Fatimids conquered the Nile Valley, the Sinai, Palestine, and southern Syria</li>
        <li>The Fatimids would later go on the take all of North Africa, Palestine, Syria, and West Saudi Arabia, Yemen</li>
        <li>In 903, the Fatimids in Syria would begin to be threatened by the Qarmatians, an extreme Shia sect that rejected Fatimid rule, during an insurrection</li>
        <li>In the early 1000s, the Seljuq turks began to attack the Fatimids and were eventually driven from Syria</li>
        <li>After their attempt to oust the Abbasid caliph as leader of the Islamic world, in 1171 the Fatimid dynasty was finally ended</li>
        <li>During the Fatimid rule, Islamic thought began to factionalize due to the Fatimids being Shia and the Abbasid caliphate being Sunni</li>
    </ul>
