    <h2>Mamluks</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At the start of the 1200s, the Ayyubids began to get attacked by Bedouin tribes and the Mongols</li>
        <li>There was also a new military power that formed in Egypt: the Mamluks, a Muslim slave army of Turkish/Circassian origin</li>
        <li>In 1250, the Mamluks overthrew the Ayyubids in Egypt.</li>
        <li>Between 1258-1260, the Mongols destroyed Syria and conquered the Ayyubid Caliphate in Aleppo</li>
        <li>In 1260, the Mamluks defeated the the remaining Crusaders and drove the Mongols from Palestine/Syria at the Battle of Ayn Jalut under the leadership of general Baybars I</li>
        <li>Baybars established a new Sunni Muslim Caliphate, reuniting Egypt/Syria, under his rule based out of Egypt</li>
        <li>The Mamluks continued to conquer the remaining Crusaders and by 1300, all the Crusaders had been expelled</li>
        <li>Under the Mamluks the Ayyubid land was split into 6 provinces with Damascus being the most important</li>
        <li>Under Mamluks rule, Sunni Islamic culture flourished and minorities such as Druze, Christians, Ismailis (Shias) were severely persecuted in fear that they might cooperate with the Crusaders if they tried to return</li>
        <li>In 1382, the Mamluks had their first Circassian sultan (before they were all Turkish) and the Mamluks fell into decline after this</li>
        <li>In 1400, Timur invaded and destroyed Aleppo and Damascus</li>
        <li>In 1405, Timur died and the Mamluks took back Syria</li>
        <li>However, the damage had been done by Timur and the Mamluk empire continued to decline for the next 100 years</li>
        <li>In 1516, the Mamluks were overthrown by the rising Ottoman Empire in both Egypt and Syria</li>
    </ul>
