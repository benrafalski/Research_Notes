    <h2>Syria During WWI</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1914, the Young Turks saw the Germans as the strongest power in WWI and decided to join the Ottoman Empire into the war on the side of the Central Powers to protect against potential Russian agression</li>
        <li>After entering the war, Syria became an Ottoman military base</li>
        <li>In 1915, the British had 250,000 troops in Egypt, fearing an offeisive by the Turks from Palestine</li>
        <li>This fear waned after the rebellion of the Hashimite Husayn against the Turks at he Hejaz railroad in Damascus</li>
        <li>In the summer of 1917, Allenby transferred his headquarters form Cairo to Palestine to prepare for an offensive against the Turks</li>
        <li>The Turkish commander Falkenhayn was stationed in Aleppo and was also planning an offensive into the Sinai</li>
        <li>However, Allenby struck first and by December 1917, he had captured Jerusalem</li>
        <li>In 1918, the Turkish fronts ran from the Jordan River to Jericho, with three Turkish divisions</li>
        <li>The divisions depended on the Hejaz Railway in Damascus for supplies</li>
        <li>In September 1918, at the battle of Megiddo, Allenby attacked the Turks in the north of Palestine in a suprise attack</li>
        <li>This proved to be wildly succesfull with the British capturing Damascus, Allepi and Baghdad over by October</li>
        <li>The Ottomans saw that they were surrounded at this point and capitulated</li>
        <li>In the Armistice of Mudros in October 1918, the Ottomans surrendered in Arabia, Syria, and Mesopotamia and gave up their territories to Allied occupation</li>
        <li>This marked the end of the Ottoman Empire</li>
    </ul>
