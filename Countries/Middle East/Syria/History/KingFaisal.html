    <h2>King Faisal</h2>
    <h3>1916 Arab Revolt</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1908, Hussein ibn Ali became emir (prince) of Mecca, which was still under Ottoman control</li>
        <li>During this time, Islamic Arab nationalism was growing in opposition to the Turks and Hussein did not trust the Young Turk administration of the Ottomans and reached out to the British for help</li>
        <li>At first, the British were reluctant to help, that is until the Ottomans entered WWI in 1914</li>
        <li>Between 1915-16 during WWI, in what became the Hussein-McMahon correspondence, Hussein exchanged a series of letters with the British high commissioner in Egypt, Henry McMahon</li>
        <li>The Hussein-McMahon correspondence effectively promised British support for an independent Arab state in exchange for an Arab aid in fighting the Ottoman Empire</li>
        <li>However, the letters were highly ambiguous and in no way a formal treaty, territory for the final Arab state was to be decided at a later date as well</li>
        <li>Eventually, confilicts of intrest arose with the Sykes-Picot Agreement (British-France agreement to divide Ottomand territory after WWII) and the Balfour Declaraiton (British promise of a Jewish state in Palestine)</li>
        <li>However, in June 1916, Hussein was convinced he had British support and led the Arab revolt against the Ottomans and with British support took the Hejaz, Damascus, and parts of Jordan</li>
        <li>He proclaimed himself "king of the Arab countries" but the Allies only recognized him as king of the Hejaz</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>King Faisal administration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In late 1918, Hussein's son Faisal led a campaign that took Damascus where he set up an administration</li>
        <li>In September 1918, Faisal was declared king of Syria by Gen. Allenby, Faisal at this time still believed he had support for an Arab state</li>
        <li>In March 1920, Faisal declared independence from foreign influence of "Greater Syria" and named himself king of a new consitiutional monarchy</li>
        <li>Greater Syria included Syria, Transjordan, Palestine, and Lebanon, which was in conflict with the French territory</li>
        <li>However, in 1919 at the Treaty of Versailles, Faisal became aware that the French were determined to control Syria and Lebanon and was eventually forced to make concessions, agreeing to a French military occupation in Lebanon and Syria</li>
        <li>In April 1920, at the Confrence of San Remo, the French were given Syria under the French Mandate</li>
        <li>Between January (when king Faisal returned to Damascus) and April 1920, violent unrest in Syria broke out of Faisal's control and was crushed by the French, forcing Faisal into exile</li>
        <li>Faisal went to London after being invited by the British government</li>
        <li>The British had a sphere of influence in Iraq and installed Faisal as the king of Iraq in August 1921</li>
        <li>By 1932, Faisal had negotiated complete independence for Iraq and membership into the League of Nations</li>
    </ul>
