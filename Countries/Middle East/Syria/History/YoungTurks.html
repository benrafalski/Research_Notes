    <h2>Young Turks Revolution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Between 1839-1876, the Ottomans underwent the Tanzimat reforms</li>
        <li>The Tanzimat reforms were inspired by European administration and gave equal rights to citizens, a standardized tax system, a new secular school system, state courts independent of the ulama</li>
        <li>In 1876, Abdulhamid II became sultan and suspended the new 1876 Ottoman constitution by 1878</li>
        <li>In 1889, a group of student a the Imperial Medical Academy in Istanbul initiated a conspiracy against Sultan Abdulhamid, in response to his centralization on power</li>
        <li>The group dissemnitated liberal and democratic thought against the authoritarian Ottoman regime</li>
        <li>They eventually had to move their movement to Paris after being found out</li>
        <li>This allowed discontent to grow from within the Ottoman empire, specifically among the III Army Corps in Macedonia</li>
        <li>In 1906, they formed the revolutionary Liberty Society in 1906 and merged with the Young Turks main political group (CUP)</li>
        <li>In July 1908, the Corps led a revolt in Resna and the rebellion quickly spread</li>
        <li>This forced Abdulhamid to reinstate the 1876 contitution and reform parliament, the Young Turks had achieved their goal</li>
        <li>By 1913, the Young Turks had effectively taken control of the Ottoman government</li>
        <li>Following the revolution, Syrian patriotic feelings began to become more conscious and the first Syrian political parties began to form in Cairo, Constantinople, Paris, and Syria itself</li>
