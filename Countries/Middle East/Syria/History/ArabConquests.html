        <li>In 622, the prophet Muhammad started the Islamic conquests to spread Islam throughout the Middle East</li>
        <li>In 633-634, led by Khalid al-Walid, the Islamic conquests began in Syria</li>
        <li>In 635, Damascus fell to the Islamic army, the Syrians got to keep their property as long as they payed a poll tax</li>
        <li>In 636, Heraclius staged a counter attack in the Arabs but was defeated</li>
        <li>In 640, Syria was absorbed into the Caliphate</li>
        <li>Syria was divided into four districts (junds): Damascus, Homs, Jordan, and Palestine</li>
