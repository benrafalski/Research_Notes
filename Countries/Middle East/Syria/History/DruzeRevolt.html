    <h2>Great Syrian Revolt</h2>
    <h3>Jabal al-Druze Revolt</h3>
    <ul>
        
        <li>The revolt broke out mainly because: the Syrians rejected the French occupation, the spliting of Syria into states</li>
        <li>In 1925, the Druze leaders (al-Atrash family) and the French high commissioner met because the Druze wanted the French general in their state to be replaced</li>
        <li>The high commissioner rejected their position, threatened them with punishment, and antagonised the Al-Atrash family to diminish their influence</li>
        <li>In 1925, these local grievances sparked the revolt to break out in the Jabal al-Druze State, led by Sultan al-Atrash</li>
        <li>The revolt was an extension of the unrest that occured in 1920 after the French occupation of Syria started</li>
        <li>The revolutionaries demanded a independent Syria and an end to the French occupation with the establishment of a Syrian National Congress</li>
        <li>In October 1925, the rebels entered the city of Damascus resulting in a two day bombardment by the French</li>
        <li>The revolt would continue until 1927, however the French had gained back some control by the end of 1925</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The People's Party</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Druze rebels and nationalists of Damascus eventually joined together in the People's Party</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>End of revolution and Aftermath</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1928, new elections were held for a Constituent Assembly</li>
        <li>The Syrian nationalists won the elections and formed an assembly which drafter a constitution</li>
        <li>However, the constitution was not accepted by the high commissioner due to Syrian unification and didn't include the French position of control</li>
    </ul>
