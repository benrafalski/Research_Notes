    <h2>Ottoman Decline</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>During the late 1600s, there was widespread unrest in Ottoman territory but Ottoman rule remained stable</li>
        <li>However, after 1700, the central government began to weaken in their administration and the Janissaries (elite army of the sultan) lost their order</li>
        <li>This resulted in declining agricultural production due to falling tax collections and Bedouin attacks</li>
        <li>The Ottoman authority revived somewhat in Damascus, ruled by the Azm family who was loyal to the sultan</li>
        <li>The Azams reordered the Janissares and stopped Bedouin incursions</li>
        <li>Ottoman authority was also revived in Sidon (Lebanon) by the Bosnian governor Ahmad al-Jazzar from 1775-1804</li>
        <li>At the start of the 1800s, Alepppo and Damascus remained prosperous but most of the Ottoman empire continued to decline and the population was not able to be controlled anymore</li>
        <li>In 1831, the Egyptians entered an army into Palestine and eventually controlled Syria and Asia Minor from the Ottomans</li>
    </ul>
