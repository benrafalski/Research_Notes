    <h2>Abbasid Rule</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After the Abbasids took over in 750, power shifted from Syria to Iraq</li>
        <li>This made Syria a dependent state of the caliphate</li>
        <li>During Abbasid rule, Umayyad sentiment still remained, until 905, when the last pro-Umayyad revolt was crushed</li>
        <li>Under the Abbasids, Christians were not favored as much and Islamic conversion spread</li>
        <li>Arabic also spread during this time, over Greek and Aramaic</li>
        <li>Finally, in 877, Syria was annexed by the Tulunid dynasty in Egypt</li>
    </ul>
