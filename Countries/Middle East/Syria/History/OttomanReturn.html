    <h2>Ottoman Return</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1840, the Eurpoeans signed the Treaty of London and forced the Egyptians to forfeit their rule back to the Ottomans</li>
        <li>Following this, the Druze and Maronites fell into conflict in Lebanon</li>
        <li>In Syria, the Ottomans tried a new system of taxation anc conscription but caused social unrest</li>
        <li>Religious tensions also rose as the Muslim majority began to become aware of the European influence on the Christian and Jewish minorities in the region</li>
        <li>This influence resulted in a flood of European goods into Syria from Christian and Jewish merchants</li>
        <li>In 1860, the Druze-Maronite civil war in Lebanon caused a massacre of Christians by Muslims in Damascus</li>
        <li>The Ottomans responded by sending a special commission to restore order and France sent a special force as well</li>
        <li>The Europeans then concluded that Lebanon should become its own automonous region (mutasarrifiyyah) but left Syria as it was</li>
        <li>From 1888, there were then 3 Ottoman provinces in Syria: Damascus, Aleppo, and Beirut</li>
        <li>Around then, the French built a railway from Damascus to Beirut</li>
        <li>In 1908, the Hejaz Railway was built to link Damasucus to Medina for the Mulsim pilgrimage</li>
        <li>During this time, Aleppo had 200,000 people and Damascus had 250,000</li>
        <li>These large cities saw a massive increase in Western culture from 1860-1910</li>
        <li>This included middle/upper classes wearing western European clothing, Western schools and universities opening, but also Muslim schools for young men</li>
    </ul>
