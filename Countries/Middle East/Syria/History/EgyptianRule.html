    <h2>Egyptian Rule</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Following the incursions into Ottoman territory in the early 1800s the Egyptians finally broke through</li>
        <li>In 1831, the Egyptian ruler Muhammad Ali sent his son Ibrahim Pasha with an army into Palestine, following a disagreement between the Ottoman sultan Mahmud II</li>
        <li>By 1832, with the help of local leaders, like prince Bashir in Lebanon, Ibrahim eventually took over Syria and Asia Minor (Turkey)</li>
        <li>In 1833, the Ottomans signed the Convention of Kutahya, ceding Syria and Turkey to Egypt</li>
        <li>Ibrahim ruled Syria for close to the next decade and administered from Damascus with the help of Bashir for political matters</li>
        <li>Ibrahim introduced a new tax system that was strict, especially on the Bedouin, and encouraged agriculture</li>
        <li>The strict nature of the taxes and forced conscription eventually made Ibrahim widely unpopular</li>
        <li>In 1839, Ottoman sultan Mahmud sent an army into Syria but Ibrahim defeated the Ottoman army</li>
        <li>The European powers, except France, didn't want Egyptian rule and preferred the Ottomans in fear of a European crisis due to Ottoman disintegration</li>
        <li>In 1840, a British, Ottoman, and Austrian force entered Syria and the British negotiated the Treaty of London</li>
        <li>The Treaty of London was agreed to by Britain, Russiaa, Austria, and Prussia and it said Muhammad Ali had to forfeit Syria and Turkey</li>
        <li>The British and Austrian forces eventually forced the Eyptians from Syria and returned control to the Ottomans</li>
    </ul>
