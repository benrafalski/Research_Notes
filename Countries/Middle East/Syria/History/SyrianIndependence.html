    <h2>Syrian Independence</h2>
    <h3>World War II</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In June 1940, the Franco-German armistice was signed and the French announced they would cease hostilities against the Germans and Italians and recognize the Vichy government</li>
        <li>The Franco-German armistice cause unrest to break out in Syria</li>
        <li>After the armistice, the Free French arose, led by General Charles de Gaulle, as the main military resistance against the Germans</li>
        <li>In May 1941, the Vichy government let the Germans use Syria to refuel aircraft</li>
        <li>However, by June 1941, British, Commonwealth, and Free French forces invaded the Vichy forces in Syria and occupied it by June 21</li>
        <li>Until 1946, Syria was jointly occupied by British and French forces</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Shukri al-Quwatli</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Quwatli was orginially a member of the National Bloc in the early 1930s</li>
        <li>By 1940, Quwatli became the leader of the Bloc due to his tolerance for corruption by other members of the Bloc</li>
        <li>When Syria became independent in 1943, Quwatli was elected their first president</li>
        <li>In 1947, Quwalti enacted a contitutional amendment removing one-term limits and he was reelected in 1948</li>
        <li>In March 1949, Quwalti was overthrown in a military coup due to his failure in the Arab-Israli war in 1948 and overall disatisfaction with his rule</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Independence</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the Free French invaded Syria in 1941, they declared Syria and Lebanon independent</li>
        <li>The British guaranteed this, recognizing the French in Lebanon and Syria as long as independence was indeed reached</li>
        <li>Thus, Britian persuaded the Free French to have Syrian elections in 1943, giving Syria independence</li>
        <li>In the 1943 elections, the nationalist won and Quwatli became president</li>
        <li>From 1943-1946, there was a period of disagreement between the Syrian and French over the transfer of administration</li>
        <li>In 1945, a the French refused to transfer control of the local armed forces leading to unrest and the French to bomb Damascus</li>
        <li>After the crisis, Winston Churchhill ordered British troops to invade Syria to quell the violence and with negotiations in the UNSC a French/British withdraw from Syria/Lebanon was agreed upon</li>
        <li>By April 1946, all French/British troops had left Syria, leaving the sole administration of the country to the republic government</li>
        <li>Also, Syria became a founding member of the UN and Arab League</li>
    </ul>
