    <h2>Paleolithic and Mesolithic Periods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Earliest found human remains are from the Middle Paleolithic Period
        around 700,000 years ago
      </li>
      <li>
        By the Mesolithic Period, Natufian culture began to spread through the
        Levant (Syria and Palestine)
      </li>
      <li>The Natufians fished, hunted, and gathered grains</li>
      <li>
        They eventually domesticated animals, began to produce pottery, and
        cultivated single-grained wheat
      </li>
      <li>
        By 4000 BC, Syrians began to produce bronze and shortly after began to
        build cities
      </li>
    </ul>
