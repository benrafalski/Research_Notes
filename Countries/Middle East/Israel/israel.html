                        <ul>
                            <li>Old method: GHM used to certify each death using a collection system from hospitals and morgues during the first month of the war. This collection system was relatively accurate in the past and lined up with UNRWA death counts during Oct 7 - Nov 10.</li>
                            <li>New method: When hospitals began to shut down, on Nov. 10 the GHM started to also use a new method: "reliable media reports". Accounts for more than 14,000/32,000 reported deaths. Much more difficult to verify when compared to the central collection system.  </li>
                            <li><u>Note when viewing:</u> At the start of November, most hospitals were closed. Thus, it is expected to see the death count for central collection to decrease at the start of November. <br>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Before September 2007 Israel said the closure of the border was for security purposes since the PA was no longer in control. In September they added new restrictions to pressure Hamas. The restrictions before September were still due to security purposes after September, the new restrictions were political. After September 19 did arms and munitions restictions that had previously been for security reasons change to being for political reasons?</li>
                            <li>In HCJ 9132/07 (from 2008) why did Israel say the restrictions were for both security and political purposes?
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"The goal of such measures is twofold. Firstly, reductions of the supply of fuel and electricity to Gaza are designed to hamper the war efforts, such as the firing of Kassam rockets on Israeli civilian targets, being undertaken by the terrorist organization that controls Gaza against Israel and its citizens, by means of reducing resources, particularly fuel, that are available to the organization and that are used to fuel its daily attacks on Israel. Secondly, such measures aim to put pressure on Hamas in order to bring about a reduction in hostile activities undertaken by the terrorist regime."</li>
                                    <li>"In our decision, we gave weight to the state’s position that currently, as offensive rocket attacks against Israeli towns are taking place, some of the fuel being transferred to the Gaza Strip is actually being used for different purposes by the terrorist organizations."</li>
                                    <li>"According to the respondents, this plan will force the ruling authority in the Gaza Strip to conduct load management and actively restrict the consumption of electricity in that area which is supplied by the relevant electrical line, and to prevent the supply of electricity to terrorist activities, such as workshops producing Qassam rockets and such."</li>

                                        9 October on Jabalya market, all strikes mentioned in the report were previously referred
                                        to the IDF General Staff's Fact-Finding and Assessment Mechanism and were currently

                                    <li>Prohibition of indiscriminate attacks: UN claims IDF fails this becasue they used GBU-31, 32, and 39 munitions and using them (wide area effect munitions) in densely populated areas can be nothing but indiscriminate</li>
                                    <li>The principle of proportionality: UN claims IDF fails this because they use wide area effect bombs and the ones the IDF made no response to seem to be so large that there couldn't possibly be a proportional military advantage and the ones the IDF did respond to seem to be disproportionate with the given information.</li>
