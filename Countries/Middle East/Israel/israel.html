                        <ul>
                            <li>Old method: GHM used to certify each death using a collection system from hospitals and morgues during the first month of the war. This collection system was relatively accurate in the past and lined up with UNRWA death counts during Oct 7 - Nov 10.</li>
                            <li>New method: When hospitals began to shut down, on Nov. 10 the GHM started to also use a new method: "reliable media reports". Accounts for more than 14,000/32,000 reported deaths. Much more difficult to verify when compared to the central collection system.  </li>
                            <li><u>Note when viewing:</u> At the start of November, most hospitals were closed. Thus, it is expected to see the death count for central collection to decrease at the start of November. <br>

                            <li>Still says 35,000 are dead but says 21,000 have been bodies confirmed at hospitals, 3,700 are dead reported online with identity numbers, and 10,000 are having "incomplete data" (bodies with no identity number or name)</li>
                            <li>Estimates 10,000 are dead under rubble</li>
                            <li>Previous estimates had women and children dead at over 70% of the total, revised numbers changed to 60%</li>
                            <li>WHO says previous robust GHM system of calculating death numbers was credible</li>
                            <li>Lancet peer-reviewed article in Lancet says that first 7,000 deaths were not likely fabricated</li>
                            <li>Hamas control of the GHM is hard to assess due to IDF occupation in most of Gaza</li>
                            <li>Netanyahu says he believes 14,000 Hamas militants have been killed and 16,000 civilians, Hamas says those numbers are exaggerated but did not provide their own death toll</li>

                    <li>Claims: "Israel banned the import of books, candles, crayons, clothing, cups, cutlery, crockery, electric appliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, glasses, light bulbs, matches, musical instruments, needles, sheets, blankets, shoes, mattresses, spare machine and car parts, and thread"</li>
                    <li>This claim seems to lead back to the same Gisha report where they just interviewed Gazans and humanitarian groups who said they "deduced" if items had been banned from their experience with item imports and from an Amira Hass Haaretz article that references Gazan merchants and human rights activists</li>
                    <li>Israel says they actually do not even have a banned list, items are allowed or rejected based on "who has packaged the products and where do they come from"</li>

                    <li>Claim: "Israel had the blockade solely to pressure and sanction Hamas and get the Gazan popultion to turn on them"
                        <ol>
                            <li>Before September 2007 Israel said the closure of the border was for security purposes since the PA was no longer in control. In September they added new restrictions to pressure Hamas. The restrictions before September were still due to security purposes after September, the new restrictions were political. After September 19 did arms and munitions restictions that had previously been for security reasons change to being for political reasons?</li>
                            <li>In HCJ 9132/07 (from 2008) why did Israel say the restrictions were for both security and political purposes?
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"The goal of such measures is twofold. Firstly, reductions of the supply of fuel and electricity to Gaza are designed to hamper the war efforts, such as the firing of Kassam rockets on Israeli civilian targets, being undertaken by the terrorist organization that controls Gaza against Israel and its citizens, by means of reducing resources, particularly fuel, that are available to the organization and that are used to fuel its daily attacks on Israel. Secondly, such measures aim to put pressure on Hamas in order to bring about a reduction in hostile activities undertaken by the terrorist regime."</li>
                                    <li>"In our decision, we gave weight to the state’s position that currently, as offensive rocket attacks against Israeli towns are taking place, some of the fuel being transferred to the Gaza Strip is actually being used for different purposes by the terrorist organizations."</li>
                                    <li>"According to the respondents, this plan will force the ruling authority in the Gaza Strip to conduct load management and actively restrict the consumption of electricity in that area which is supplied by the relevant electrical line, and to prevent the supply of electricity to terrorist activities, such as workshops producing Qassam rockets and such."</li>

                                    <li>"we note that when it comes to the admission of dual-use goods,there is a careful inspection in order to prevent a security risk and to prevent the exploitation of the admission of the product by the terror apparatuses for their use."</li>

                                    <li>"The objective of this law is to regulate state control of the export of defense equipment, the transfer of defense know-how and the provision of defense services, for reasons of national security considerations, foreign relations considerations, international obligations and other vital interests of the State."</li>

                                    <li>"There is no fixed list of banned products. And the real question here is, where are these imports coming from? We know that Gaza is ruled by Hamas, who will use anything to manufacture military devices to attack Israel."</li>
