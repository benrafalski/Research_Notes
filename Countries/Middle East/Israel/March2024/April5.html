    <h3>IDF response to WCK strike</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>IDF dismisses two officers and reprimanded three others for rolw in WCK strikes</li>
        <li>Findings come from retired IDF general's,Yoav Har-Even, investigation</li>
        <li style="padding-left: 4em;"><i>Military spokespeople said that under the Israeli army’s rules of engagement, officers must have more than one reason for identifying someone as a target before they can be hit. But the investigation determined that a colonel had authorized the series of deadly drone strikes on the convoy based on one major’s observation — from grainy drone-camera footage — that someone in the convoy was armed. That observation turned out to be untrue, military officials said. The army said the colonel and the major were dismissed, while three other officers were reprimanded, the most senior of whom was the head of the Southern Command. It said the results of its investigation were turned over to the military’s advocate general, who will decide whether the officers or anyone else involved in the killings should receive further punishment or be prosecuted.</i></li>
        <li>The army said the order was given after one of the passengers inside a car was identified as a gunman.</li>
        <li>After the aid was dropped off at a warehouse, an officer believed he had spotted a gunman boarding one of the cars.</li>
        <li>The passenger, it turned out, was not carrying a weapon — the military said it’s possible he was just carrying a bag</li>
    </ul>
