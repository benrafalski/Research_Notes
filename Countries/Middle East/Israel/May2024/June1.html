    <h3>Israel-Biden Truce Proposal</h3>
    <h4>Phase 1</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Last 6 weeks</li>
        <li>"Full and complete" ceasefire</li>
        <li>Withdraw of IDF forces from "all polulated areas"</li>
        <li>"Release of a number of hostages including women, the elderly, the wounded in exchange for release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners."</li>
        <li>Return of all Gazans to their homes/neighborhoods in all areas of Gaza</li>
        <li>Allow for 600 trucks of humanitarian aid into Gaza everyday</li>
        <li>Talks between Israel and Hamas on the next stage of the proposal</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Phase 2</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>"A permanent end to hostilities."</li>
        <li>Will only begin after the first phase negotiations are done</li>
        <li>If phase 1 takes longer than 6 weeks, the ceasefire will be extended</li>
        <li>Release of all remaining hostages that are alive, including male soldiers</li>
        <li>All IDF forces to withdraw from Gaza</li>
        <li>Biden: "And as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments, a temporary ceasefire will become - in the words of the Israeli proposal - the cessation of hostilities permanently."</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Phase 3</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>"A major reconstruction plan for Gaza would commence and any final remains of hostages who have been killed would be returned to their families."</li>
        <li>Biden: "At this point, Hamas no longer is capable of carrying out another Oct. 7."</li>
        <li>Reconstruction of Gaza with the help of Arab nations and the international community in a "manner that does not allow Hamas to rearm"</li>
    </ul>
