    <h2>Mozaffar al-Din Shah</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mozaffar was weak and an incompetent leader who was not prepared to take the throne.</li>
        <li>He faced a financial crisis so he got unpopular loans from Russia in exchange for political concessions.</li>
        <li>Mozaffar then made extravagant trips to Europe from 1900-05 with the loan money.</li>
        <li>In 1901, Mozaffar then made an oil concession to Willian D'Arcy that gave him exclusive rights to Iran's oil fields for 60-years.</li>
        <li>Under Mozaffar al-Din the mujtahids began to become more involved in government and Shi'i merchants and landowners began to call for political and legal reforms.</li>
        <li>His corruption and failure to control the financial crisis eventually brought a demand for a new constitution in Iran in 1906.</li>
    </ul>
