    <h2>Iranian intermezzo</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 821, Tahir ibn al-Husayn established the Tahirid dynasty in Khorasan and was the start of Persian independence</li>
        <li>The dynasty was loyal to the Abbasid caliphate but enjoyed virtual independence.</li>
        <li>The Abbasid caliphate had trouble in Khorasan and felt it was easier to appoint a great general to govern the area instead</li>
        <li>Tahir would die soon after being appointed but his family would still rule until Yaâ€™qub overthrew them.</li>
    </ul>
