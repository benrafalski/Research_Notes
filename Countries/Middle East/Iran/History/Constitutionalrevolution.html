    <h2>Constitutional revolution</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The growing influence of the West in Iranian education sparked interest in democratic institutions.</li>
        <li>Between 1905-06 there were multiple protests over government beatings that occurred in Tehran.</li>
        <li>Eventually, in August 1906, Mozaffar al-Din was forced to grant the demonstrators a constitution.</li>
        <li>In October, the Majles was opened and the Belgium modeled constitution provided a framework</li>
        <li>The framework provided for secular legislation, a new judicial code, and free press, placing more power with the Majles and less power with the clergy and throne.</li>
        <li>The Majles took a strong stance against European intervention.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Education Reforms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>From 1905-1907, a nationwide, public, primary school system was proposed and approx 3,300 schools were established by the end of the Qajar dynasty.</li>
        <li>Under the new Majles, they also introduced new reforms that established secular schools and schools for girls.</li>
        <li>This caused increased tension between the clergy and the Majles.</li>
    </ul>
