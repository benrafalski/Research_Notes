    <h2>The Ghaznavids</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 977, the Samanids made Sebuktigin the governor of Ghazni in Afghanistan, who established the Ghaznavid dynasty.</li>
        <li>Subuktigin eventually rejected the Samanids.</li>
        <li>In 997 Sebuktigin died and was succeeded by his son, Mahmud, who took control of Khorasan from the Samanids.</li>
        <li>Mahmud was staunchly Sunni and gave his allegiance to the Abbasid caliph, who recognized him in return, encouraging him on his conquests.</li>
    </ul>
