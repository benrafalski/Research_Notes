    <h2>The Saffarids</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 866, Ya'qub took Sistan and eventually seized Fars and Khuzestan by 869.</li>
        <li>In 873, he took over Khorasan and overthrew the Tahirids.</li>
        <li>Ya'qub's army was made up of Kharijites and men from Sistan and he had legitimacy with the caliphate for spreading Islam in Afghanistan and India.</li>
        <li>In 873, Ya'qub marched on Baghdad to overthrow the caliph but was defeated.</li>
        <li>In 879 he died and the caliph reluctantly made his brother, Amr ibn Layth,  the governor of Khorasan, Fars, and Sistan.</li>
        <li>Ya'qub will be remembered for leading the Iranian revival.</li>
    </ul>
