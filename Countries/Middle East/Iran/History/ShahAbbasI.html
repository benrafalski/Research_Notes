    <h2>Shah Abbas I</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1524 Isma'il died and his son, Tahmasp, became Shah.</li>
        <li>He fought the Ottomans for a while before signing a peace treaty with them in 1555</li>
        <li>He retreated from public affairs following that</li>
        <li>In 1588 Abbas became Shah.</li>
        <li>Having conflicts on both sides from the Ottomans in the west and Uzbeks in the east, he signed a peace treaty with the Ottomans in 1589</li>
        <li>This ceded land to the Ottomans in northwest Persia, and he focused on the Uzbeks.</li>
        <li>However, he failed in offensives for 10 years and ended up losing land to both the Uzbeks and India because of his decision to create a standing army.</li>
        <li>Eventually, in 1598, he succeeded against the Uzbeks and took Khorasan.</li>
        <li>In 1602 he successfully attacked the Ottomans and recovered the territory he gave to them in the peace treaty.</li>
        <li>After these victories, Abbas made Esfahan the capital of Iran</li>
        <li>He turned it into one of the most beautiful cities in the world with sites such as Masjed-e Emam.</li>
    </ul>
