    <h2>Turkmen</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>From 1375-1468 the Kara Koyunlu (Black sheep), descendants of the Jalayirids, dominated western Iran in Azerbaijan.</li>
        <li>In 1402 Timur gave northern Iraq to Kara Osman, the leader of the Kara Koyunlu rival, Ak Koyunlu (white sheep).</li>
        <li>By 1467, Ak Koyunlu, now led by Uzun Hasan, defeated the Kara Koyunlu and took over west Iran and Azerbaijan</li>
        <li>By 1469 he controlled all of Iran</li>
        <li>Uzun Hasan was eventually defeated by the Ottoman Turks and his son Ya'qub supplanted him</li>
        <li>Ya'qub tried to revive Sunni values in the area but failed and only gave the incentive for Shi'ism to spread.</li>
    </ul>
