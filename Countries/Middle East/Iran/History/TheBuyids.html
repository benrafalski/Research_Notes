    <h2>The Buyids</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The three sons of Buyeh: Imad al-Dawlah, Rukn al-Dawlah, and Mu’izz al-Dawlah founded the Buyid dynasty.</li>
        <li>Starting in 930, the three brothers captured a majority of Iran</li>
        <li>in 945, Mu'izz captured Baghdad and all of Iraq</li>
        <li>He turned the Abbasid caliphate into his puppet, de facto establishing Buyid rule.</li>
        <li>The Buyids contributed to the Iranian renaissance along with the Samanids. </li>
        <li>They were a Shi'i Islamic dynasty with strong Iranian culture but chose to maintain the Sunni caliphate.</li>
        <li>From 1030-1040 the Seljuqs began to grow in power and pushed the Ghaznavids out of Iran.</li>
        <li>Eventually in 1055, the Seljuqs marched on Baghdad and ended Buyid control and the “Iranian intermezzo” era.</li>
    </ul>
