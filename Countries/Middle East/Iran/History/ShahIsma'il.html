    <h2>Shah Isma'il</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the 1480's Shaykh Haydar founded the Safavid movement</li>
        <li>The Safavids were an extreme Shi'i movement against the Ak Koyunlu.</li>
        <li>Haydar was eventually killed in battle with Ak Koyunlu</li>
        <li>In 1501, Isma'il revived the Safavids in northwestern Iran</li>
        <li>He quickly conquested the rest of Iran and parts of Iraq, Turkey, and Uzbekistan, establishing the Safavids as a dynasty.</li>
        <li>Under Ismail's rule Iran was fully converted to Twelver Shi'ism.</li>
        <li>In 1514, the Ottomans, who were Sunni, attacked the Safavids and took over the Safavid capital but withdrew after a mutiny among the Ottoman troops.</li>
        <li>Following this, Isma'il slowed his expansion and focused more domestically. </li>
        <li>However, the Ottoman conflict still continued with various skirmishes.</li>
    </ul>
