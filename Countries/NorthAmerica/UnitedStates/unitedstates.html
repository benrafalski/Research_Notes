                                        <li>Was assassinated while riding in presidental motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas</li>
                                        <li>Kennedy was in the vehicle with is wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connaly's wife Nellie</li>
                                        <li>Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, former US Marine, from the nearby Texas School Book Depository 250 ft away</li>
                                        <li>Kennedy was rushed to the Parkland Memorial Hospital and was pronounced dead 30 minutes after the shooting</li>
                                        <li>Two hours after the assassination, Lyndon B Johnson was hastily sworn in as president aboard Air Force One</li>
                                        <li>After the assassination, Owsald returned home and got a pistol that he used to kill Dallas policeman JD Tippit</li>
                                        <li>Oswald was eventually apprehended by Dallas police about an hour after Kennedy and Connally were shot and was charged with the murders of Kennedy and Tippit</li>
                                        <li>Two days later on 24 Nov 1963, a live TV camera showing Oswald being moved in the Dallas Police Headquarters captured Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby, Oswald died</li>
                                        <li>Ruby was convicted of murdering Oswald, but was overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 awaiting a new trial</li>
                                        <li>The Warren commission spent 10 months investigating the murder and concluded Oswald assassinated Kennedy and that neither Oswald or Ruby were part of a conspiracy</li>
                                        <li>In 1967, the New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison brought the only trial for Kennedy's murder against Clay Shaw, who was aquitted</li>
                                        <li>Further investigations also found that Oswald acted alone including the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee</li>
                                        <li>However, in 1979, the US House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was murdered as part of a conspiracy</li>
                                        <li>The HSCA said there was a high probability there were two gunmen, based on a police Dictabelt recording that was later debunked by the US DOJ</li>

                                        Before being sworn in, Hegseth was controversial due to him being accused in an affidavit by his former sister-in-law saying he abused his second ex-wife, him paying a women $50,000 in 2017 who accused him of sexual assault, him excessively drinking, him financially mismanaging veterans' organizations. 
                                        On Hegseth's first day in office, he referred to the names of Confederate generals that were once used for two key bases: Fort Moore and Fort Liberty by their previous names, Fort Benning and Fort Bragg.

                                        During her confimation hearing, Bondi vowed to maintain independence in the DOJ.
                                        However, when Trump took office he signed an EO ordering Bondi to investigate the "weaponization" of the DOJ.
                                        Bondi previously joined Trump in echoing false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.
                                        Bondi holds stake in Trump's media company, the Trump Media and Technology Group, and was previously the Florida state attorney general.
                                        Trump had originally chosen Matt Gaetz to be AG, until Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration and resigned from Congress just before a House of Representatives ethics report found that he had paid women for sex and drugs and obstructed Congress.

                                        During his hearing, Burgum said he would expand oil and gas drilling rights auctions and support permitting reforms to speed development of transmission lines and pipelines, a sharp turn from Biden's policies of limiting drilling on federal lands in favor of renewable sources.

                                        Before the vote Dems staged a marathon overnight voting session, denouncing Vought as a dangerous far-right ideologue.
                                        Vought had previously headed the OMB under Trump's first term.
                                        Vought was controversial because he criticized a 1974 impoundment law, preventing the president from unilaterally blocking congressionally approved funding, as unconstitutional.
                                        Vought also had links to the hard-right Project 2025 policy initiative, which he helped author.

                                                        On the same day, Trump fired FBI officials from Miami, Philadelphia, Washington, New Orleans, Las Vegas, and Los Angles; 5 more FBI officials working at the FBI headquarters were also ordered to leave.         
                                                        Also on 2/5/25, the DOJ head Bove said they would not fire any FBI agents if the only reason they worked on the Jan 6 investigation was because they were ordered to.
                                                        Bove in the same statement said "The only individuals who should be concerned ... are those who acted with corrupt or partisan intent."

                                                        A few day later on 2/5/2025, 2 separate groups of FBI employees sued the DOJ seeking to protect the identities of agents involved in investigating Trump for Jan 6, following FBI leadership sending a list of Jan 6 investigators to Trump the day before.
                                                        The lawsuits was place in Washington DC and said "Plaintiffs reasonably fear that all or parts of this list might be published by allies of President Trump, thus placing themselves and their families in immediate danger of retribution by the now pardoned and at-large Jan. 6 convicted felons." 
                                                        Despite the lawsuits, some of those pardoned on Jan 6 took to social media to dox their prosecutors, calling for them to get fired.
                                                        On 2/6/2025, in the Washington DC US District judge taking the lawsuit orderd a pause on the public release of the FBI list until the next morning when the court hearing resumed, this was to protect the FBI agents from being doxxed.
                                                        Trump later agreed to not publicly disclose the names of the FBI employees involved in the Jan 6 investigation, Trump however did say that some of the FBI employees would be fired due to their role in the investigation.

                                                    Suspends the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP).
                                                    Says Dept of Homeland Security to make a report for Trump within 90 days in actions to resume refugee program.
                                                    Revoked Biden executive order 14013, which seeked to resettle refugees and plan for climate change.
                                                    After the order was signed, the Dept of Homeland Security paused several programs allowing immigrants to settle temporarily in the US.
                                                    The pause demanded an immediate end to "final decisions" on certain visa applications pending a review by the Trump administration about whether to cancel the programs permanently.

                                                            A day after the EO, 22 Dem-led states, the District of Columbia, and the city if San Fransisco sued Trump in Boston and Seattle and the American Civil Liberties Union immigrant organization also filed seperate lawsuits, both of which said Trump's order violated the 14th amendment.  
                                                            On 1/23/25, a Seattle US District judge, John Coughenour, blocked the order from being enforces for 14 days while the judge considers a long-term ruling. 
                                                            Coughenour said the order was "blatantly unconstitutional," referring to the 14th amendment that says any person born in the US is a citizen under the Citizenship Clause.  
                                                            On 2/6/2025, Coughenour extended his order, setting a nationwide injunction, saying Trump was ignoring the rule of law.
                                                            Opponents of birthright citizenship say that if the drafters of the 14th amendment wanted all people born in the US to be citizens they would not have said that citizens "be subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
                                                            They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and, by implication, their children.
                                                            However, most scholars dismiss the interpretation, since people in the country illegally are still subject to the laws of the US and are thus "subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.

                                                        Assistance includes to foreign countries from USAID and to foreign NGOs.

                                                        During Trump's first term, in 2017, he tried to move USAID to the State Department, but was blocked by Congress on a bipartisan opposition.
                                                        USAID was established by a law from Congress so Trump cannot unilaterally dismantle it or move it into the State Department.

                                                        Following the order, clinics at camps in Thailand providing shelter for about 100,000 refugees from Myanmar were ordered to shutdown.
                                                        Former head of USAID says 20 million people living with HIV get drugs from USAID to stay alive.
                                                        A week after the order, Marco Rubio issued a waiver for live-saving humanitarian assistance during the 90 day pause, despite the waiver, numerous cases of life-saving aid not being delivered remained, due to a breakdown in communication at USAID from Trump's overhaul.
                                                        Many aid workers erred on the side of caution and closed their aid programs since the US government became unresponsive to them in weather their programs qualified as "life-saving."
                                                        The aid shutdown threw the aid industry into a frenzy, as contractors usually front the costs and then bill the U.S. government, hundreds of aid contractors beginning to lay off employees.    
                                                        Real world effects: aid was stopped to civil war and disaster ridden Myanmar, anti-malaria spraying campaigns were halted in Ghana and Kenya, AIDS treatment in Haiti was paused, hospitals and health clinics in Tailand housing Myanmar refugees in 7 camps closed.

                                                        The Musk announcement came after the Trump admin placed, 2 top security chiefs at USAID: director of USAID security, John Voorhees, and his deputy, on leave after they refused to turn over classified material to Musk's DOGE team, which DOGE eventually got a hold of despite lacking the security clearance to do so.
                                                        The FBI later said they were investigating the "targeting" of Elon's staff in relation to the USAID incident, the FBI normally doesn't public discuss investigations until charges are brought.
                                                        In the same X space, Musk said he would cut $1 trillion from the budget in 2025, saying that "professional foreign fraud rings" were stealing large sums of money from the US, without giving evidence or explaining how he reached the $1 trillion figure.

                                                        On 2/3/2025, Trump made Elon a "special government employee," potentially allowing him avoid disclosure rules about conflicts of interest and finances that apply to regular government employees.
                                                        As a special government employee, Musk does not get paid and is only allowed to work for 130 days in a year and is not subject to the same conflict-of-intrest and ethics rules as federal employees.
                                                        After Trump took office, at least 3 federal lawsuit were filed saying DOGE violated federal law by operating before Trump took office and not offering their records to the public.

                                                        On the 2/1/25, Musk and his DOGE team, took access of the US Treasury Department's payment system after a days-long standoff with career Treasury official, David Lebryk, and ended with Lebryk being placed on leave then retiring.
                                                        With access to the payment system, Musk gained access to Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies.
                                                        After the takeover, Musk posted with no evidence to X that the Treasury Department had been instructed to approve payments to "known fraudulent or terrorist groups." 
                                                        On Feb 4, 2025, the Treasury said that the DOGE team had been granted "read-only access" to its payment system codes but denied that this cut off any government payments including for Social Security or Medicare.

                                                        Days after Trump took office, DOGE officials were granted admin access to all OPM computer systems.
                                                        With admin access, DOGE has access to a database called Enterprise Human Resources Integration, which contains dates of birth, Social Security numbers, appraisals, home addresses, pay grades and length of service of government workers.
                                                        The OPM was filled with former Musk employees after Trump took office, including software engineers and SpaceX VP of HR Brian Bjelde, upon which they moved sofa beds into the OPM headquarters to "work around the clock"

                                                        The White House said that the DOGE team all have the proper security clearances and are not breaking the law and that all Musk actions are first approved by Trump, they said looking at org charts is a part of any restructuring.

                                                        Musk has previously vowed to destroy the CFPB, at the same time he is seeking to enter the consumer financial marketplace.
                                                        On the same day, Trump made OMB director Russ Vought to take control of the CFPB, after Trump fired the previous CFPB head Rohit Chopra the week before.
                                                        Vought was a co-author of Project 2025, a chapter of which calls for the CFPB to be dismantled.
                                                        On Feb 9, 2025, Vought ordered all CFPB staff to suspend all activities, including the supervisin of companies they oversee, leaving the banking sector without any government oversight.
                                                        Vought also announced he was zeroing out all CFPB funding for the next quarter, saying the $700 million in cash they had on hand was sufficient.

                                                    Says "female" is a person "that produces the large reproductive cell" and "male" is a person "that produces the small reproductive cell" as conception.  
                                                    Orders federal agencies to only use the word "sex" instead of "gender" in all federal documents.
                                                    Orders agencies to remove all "gender ideology" policies and prohibits federal funds for "gender ideology".

                                                    Trump later ordered federal agencies in a memo to scrub mentions of "gender ideology" in contracts, job descriptions and social media accounts in line with this EO and place on leave any employee "whose position description involves inculcating or promoting gender ideology."
                                                    Following the memo, the CDC and other federal health agencies took down webpages with info on HIV stats on trans people, health disparities among LGBT youth, and the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System database that tracks trends in teen tobacco use, teen pregnancy, and unsafe sexual behavior.
                                                    On 1/26/25, a trans woman, known by the pseudonym Maria Moe, serving time in federal prison sued Trump soon after he signed the EO, saying it violated the constitution.
                                                    On 1/30/25, a Boston district judge temporarily blocked federal prisons from transferring Maria Moe to a men's prison and denying her gender-affirming care, her laywers argued that Trump's EO went against the 5th amendment (discriminating based on sex) and the 8th amendment (cruel and unusual punishment).
                                                    On Feb 2, 2025, the CDC withdrew all scientific papers involving CDC researchers from external journals to allow Trump to review for words including gender, transgender, LGBT and nonbinary to ensure they complied with only recognizing 2 sexes in line with this EO.

                                                        On Jan 29th, the White House offered 2 million federal full-time employees financial incentives to quit in a "deferred resignation program" to further shrink the government.
                                                        The offer went to all employees except those in immigration, national security, or the US Postal Service, and warned that a majority of agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings and layoffs and that their jobs were not guaranteed.
                                                        By the following week, it was reported that 20,000 federal employees had already taken the offer.
                                                        Following the Reagan airport plane crash, Trump exempted air traffic controllers and federal employees involved in public safety programs from the resignation offer incentives, the exemption came after ATCs already had received early retirement offers.
                                                        The TSA also said their 65,000 workforce was exempt from the offer.
                                                        On Feb 5, 2025, the CIA offered buyouts to its entire workforce, citing that it wanted to bring the agency in line with Trump's EO.
                                                        The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office were also offered buyouts in addition to the CIA.

                                                        On Feb 4, 2025, American Federation of Government Employees and two other unions sued Trump for its plan to buyout federal workers, claiming the buyout offer is "arbitrary and capricious" and violates federal law, alleging that the admin cannot guarantee the plan will be funded and has failed to consider the consequences of mass resignations.
                                                        On Feb 6, 2025, a US District judge temporarily blocked Trumps's buyout until 2/10/25 in ruling on the union's lawsuit, the judge's ruling came hours before the buyout deadline.
                                                        The ruling came even despite there already having been 60,000 federal employees who accepted the offer, out of 2.3 million total federal employees.

                                                    The working group's job is to find all anti-crypto regulations so Trump can rescind them.

                                                    Trump said that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle were planning a joint venture called Stargate to build datacenters using the government investment.

                                                    The council will meet regularly and make a report for Trump on how to make FEMA better.
                                                    FEMA has become more relevant in recent years due to an increase in natural disasters in the US.
                                                    The EO came after Trump visited disaster torn North Carolina and California, after which he vowed to sign an executive order to overhaul or eliminate the agency.
                                                    Trump had previously said that there were "serious concerns" of political bias at FEMA and that agency funds had been used for programs related to incoming migrants.

                                                    Trump had previously falsely claimed that Gavin Newsom and other officials refused to provide water from northern California to fight the fires.
                                                    This Trump EO directs more water to be used through the Central Valley Project, even if it conflicts with state or local laws, which Newsom said will not make a difference in the LA fires since they get their water from other sources and do not have a shortage.
                                                    Some hydrants went try in LA while fighting the fires but officials said that is because they were not designed to deal with such a massive disaster.

                                                        Minutes before the aid pause was set to take place on 1/31/25, a US district judge blocked Trump's spending freeze until 2/3/25 after a lawsuit was brought to the court by the National Council of Nonprofits.
                                                        Trump was also sued by Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia, who said the freeze violates the constitution.
                                                        Even though Trump rescinded the freeze, a Rhode Island district judge went ahead with a hearing over the matter saying, the states have convinced him that the "inappropriate effects" of the now-rescinded funding freeze directive "are going to continue and that hasn't changed based on comments by the president's press secretary." 
                                                        On 2/4/2025, a Washington US District judge extended the pause on Trump's plan to freeze federal loans, grants, and other assistance, saying it may have "run roughshod" over Congress's constitutional authority over government spending. 
                                                        On Feb 7, 2025, AGs from the 22 Dem states in the lawsuit asked the federal judge in their case to enforce the order blocking Trump from freezing federal funding.
                                                        The Dem AGs said that the still-frozen funds include $4.5 billion for a home electrification rebate program, at least some of $7 billion for rooftop solar panels, $5 billion supporting state, local and Native American tribal governments' greenhouse gas reduction measures and $117.5 million for air quality monitoring.

                                                        One day after the memo, on Jan 29th, the Trump admin abandoned the federal funding freeze and rescinded their original memo.
                                                        Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt also later said that depsite the memo being rescinded, the EOs on federal funding "remain in full force and effect." 
                                                        Despite the federal judge blocking of Trump's EO, hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding remained frozen. 
                                                        The constitution gives Congress power over federal spending and the president must give Congress advanced notice of impoundments before taking action.

                                                    Orders the Attorney General to analyze all court cases involving anti-Israel protests after Oct 7.
                                                    In a fact sheet on the order Trump said "To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you."
                                                    Trump also said "I will also quickly cancel the student visas of all Hamas sympathizers on college campuses, which have been infested with radicalism like never before."
                                                    The measures would likely violate the First Amemdment, which protects everyone in the US to study at American universities and deporting them for their political speech would likely be unconstitutional.
                                                    On Feb 3, 2025, the White House announced they were forming a multi-agency task force to fight antisemitism in schools and universities, including an investigation into Columbia University, Northwestern University, Portland State University, University of California, Berkeley, and University of Minnesota-Twin Cities.

                                                    Tariffs all Canada goods coming to US at an additional 25% except energy imports, which only get a 10% tariff increase.
                                                    Allows Trump to increase tariffs further if Canada retaliates.
                                                    Directs Homeland security to imform Trump when Canada has done enough at the northern border to have the tariffs lifted, or if the tariffs should be increased due to Canadian inaction.
                                                    The tariffs, came after Trump promised to impose them on the campaign trail, even though many of his Republican allies down played his threats saying Trump was just using tariffs as a negotiating tactic.
                                                    Despite Trump using fentanyl as the reason for the tariffs, the US only seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border in 2024, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexico border. 
                                                    On immigration, the US saw only 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border from Oct 2023-Sept 2024, compared to 1.53 million encounters at the Mexico border.
                                                    After the order, Canada immediately ordered retalitory tariffs against $155 billion of US goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances.
                                                    A later fact sheet from the White House said the tariffs would stay in place "until the crisis alleviated," but gave no details. 
                                                    The National Foreign Trade Council President said Trump's move threatened to raise the costs of "everything from avocados to automobiles."
                                                    An hour and a half after the order, the American national anthem was booed in the nation's capital Ottawa ahead of the opening face-off at the Ottawa Senators and Minnesota Wild National Hockey League game. The Senators won 6-0.
                                                    Analysts expect oil/gas prices to rise for consumers in the US due to the tariffs, with Canada importing some 4 million barrels per day of Canadian oil.

                                                    Following the EOs, Trump said the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China may cause "short term" pain for Americans.
                                                    Almost all fentanyl enters the US through official land crossings between the US-Mexico in California and Arizona.
                                                    The chemicals used to make fentanyl are made by Chinese companied for legal painkillers but are sometimes sold to the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, who make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into the US.
                                                    During 2024, the US seized 21,100 pounds of fentanyl at the Mexican border, the US also reported 1.53 million migrant encounters at the border beteen Oct 2023-Sept 2024.

                                                        The EO had originally stated that the "de minimis" duty exemption for packages valued at under $800 would be closed, which was previously used by discount retailers like Temu, Shein,

                                                    Pauses the 25% tariff on Mexico for 1 month due to Mexico taking actions that require Trump to analyze before taking further action on the tariffs.
                                                    The pause came after Mexico agreed to reinforce the US border with 10,000 National Guard members to stem the flow of immigrants and drugs.
                                                    At the time of the pause, there were already 10,000 Mexican troops already at the border
                                                    Previously, in 2021, Biden struck an agreement with Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala, where Mexico agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the Mexico border.
                                                    Mexico also previously sent 15,000 troops to the border in 2019 under the threat of tariffs from Trump.
                                                    However, according to the US sentencin commission, in 2023, 86.4% of individuals sentenced for fentanyl trafficking were US citizens coming into the US through legal routes, meaning the Mexico troop increase will likely do little to stop the flow of fentanyl.

                                                    The pause came after Canada agreed to have a new "fentanyl czar" and offered a $900 million border security package that included drones, helicopters, more border guards along with a US-Canada cooperative effort to fight organized crime, fentanyl smuggling and money laundering. 
                                                    However, Canada had already offered the same $900 million deal after Trump previously threatened tariffs in Dec 2024.

                                                    Over 90 countries already have sovereign wealth funds, which are used to invest government dollars in direct investments.
                                                    Alaska, Texas, and New Mexico already have their own sovereign wealth funds too for funding priorities like education and tax relief.
                                                    Unclear how the fund will be funded, typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus for funding but the US normally runs a deficit.
                                                    The fund will also likely require approval from Congress.
                                                    Bloomberg previously reported that Trump was considering turning the US International Development Finance Corp (DFC) into a sovereign wealth fund, the DFC is currently used to finance private projects in the developing world.

                                                        Trump's order was largely symbolic as it was signed at the same time that Netanyahu was visiting from Israel.
                                                        Trump commented on the UN organizations saying "It's not being well run, to be honest and they're not doing the job."
                                                        The UN reponded by saying UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "has worked tirelessly to implement many reforms ... to increase efficiency and innovation."
                                                        Before the order the US was the UNRWA's largest donor, providing $300 million-$400 million a year, UNRWA is responsible for providing aid and education to millions of Pals in Gaza, the WB, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.
                                                        Biden had previously suspended funding to UNRWA after Israel accused a dozen of its staff of being Hamas members, Congress then formally suspended contributions untim March 2025.
                                                        UNRWA later fired 9 of their staff after finding they were involved in Oct 7, a Hamas commander in Lebanon who was killed by Israel in Sept 2024 was also found to be an UNRWA member.
                                                        At the time of the order the US was also not a member of the UNHRC, after their 2022-24 term under Biden ended.
                                                        The order also called for a review of UNESCO, which the US has withheld funding for since 2011 due to the body admitting the Palestinians as a full member.

                                                        The order's purpose was to exclude transgender girls and women from female sports.
                                                        Trump signed the order at a signing ceremony with about 100 women and girls aligned behind him, many of the youngest ones wearing uniforms and sports jerseys.
                                                        In the NCAA, there are less than 10 transgender athletes among the 530,000 competing at 1,100 member schools.
                                                        Before the EO, the NCAA required trans women athleted to meet testosterone limits on a sport-by-sport basis.
                                                        However, the NCAA said they would conform to the EO and welcomed it for providing a clear national standard in the face of "a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions." 
                                                        Federal courts have usually ruled in favor of letting trans athletes compete, including by blocking an Idaho, West Virginia, Arizona, and New Hampshire trans sports ban, bt a Kentucky District Court ruled against Biden's interpretation of Title IX protecting trans people from discrimination.

                                                        Trump had previously claimed that the Biden administration used the federal government to target Christians specifically.

                                                        The order came a week after Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the ICC.
                                                        Neither the US nor Israel is a member of the ICC, which accused Israeli PM Netanyahu of war crimes and issued an arrest warrant for him.
                                                        Biden had called the warrants an abomination, and Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has accused the court of having an antisemitic bias.
                                                        Trump's EO came as Netanyahu was still visiting Washington.
                                                        A 2002 US law already authorizes the Pentagon to liberate any American or U.S. ally held by the court.
                                                        In 2022, Trump previously sanctioned the ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda for investigating war crimes by all sides of the US-Afghanistan conflict, Biden lifted the sanctions when he took office.
                                                        A day after the EO was signed, a group of 79 countries signed a joint statement saying "We reaffirm our continued and unwavering support for the independence, impartiality and integrity of the ICC."
                                                        Among those that signed the statement were France, Germany and Britain. Those that didn't sign the statement include Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy.

                                                            Trump had previously said, without citing evidence, that South Africa is confiscating land and that certain classes of people are treated "very badly."
                                                            South Africa responded to the EO saying it "lacks factual accuracy and fails to recognize South Africa's profound and painful history of colonialism and apartheid."
                                                            South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the law aimed at making it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest, defending the policy by the government had not confiscated any land.
                                                            He said the policy was aimed at evening out racial disparities in land ownership in the Black-majority nation.
                                                            Afrikaners are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers.
                                                            South Africa's British imperial masters gave most farmland to whites and in 1950, the Afrikaner National Party passed a law taking 85% of territory for themselves, kicking 3.5 million Black people off their ancestral homelands.
                                                            The African National Congress has been in power since 1994, in which some land restitution has happened, but white landowners still possess three-quarters of South Africa's freehold farmland, compared to 4% owned by black people.

                                        Ulbricht was sentence to life in prison for running the TOR site The Silk Road, which was used to conduct $214 million in drug and other illicit trade using bitcoin. 
                                        Ulbricht was found guilty of charges including distributing drugs through the internet and conspiring to commit computer hacking and money laundering.
                                        Prosecutors said some people had died from the drugs they had bought on the Silk Road site, and that Ulbricht also ordered the murder of several people to keep the site running (though there is no evidence the murders were actually carried out). 
                                        Trump had promised to pardon Ulbricht on the campaign trail while at the Libertarian National Convention.

                                                The post came after Trump spent the entire campaign trail saying he would have a deal between the countries by his first day in office, which his admin now conceeded with take months or longer.

                                                On Feb 6, 2025, AG Pam Bondi ordered the DOJ to disband the Task Force KleptoCapture, which was established after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to sanction and target oligarchs close to the Kremlin.
                                                Bondi said that resources being used to target the Russian oligarchs would be transferred to targeting drug cartels at the US border. 
                                                The task force brought indictments against aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska and TV tycoon Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions busting, and seized yachts belonging to sanctioned oligarchs Suleiman Kerimov and Viktor Vekselberg.
                                                The cases being investigated by the task force are likely to continue, but no longer be at the DOJ.
                                                The disbanding of the task force is likely to bring a sharp decline in the pace of charges brought on Russian oligarchs.

                                                Trump originally said that Palestinians should be permanently removed from Gaza but his press secratary Karoline Leavitt walked back Trump's assertion saying that instead they should be "temporarily relocated" for the rebuilding process.

                                                The limited response from Chine underscores their attempt to engage Trump in talks, which were not yet scheduled, before engaging in an all out trade war.

                                            <li>On Feb 1, 2025, Trump started a trade war by imposing a 25% tariff on all goods coming from Canada, except energy goods, which only got a 10% tariff.
                                                Trump cited Canada's failure to curb fentanyl flow into the US as why he imposed the tariffs.
                                                Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, said Canada would respond with tariffs on $155 billion of US goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances, beginning with $30 billion taking effect 2/4/25 and $125 billion 21 days later.
                                                Trudeau urged Canadians to forego travel to the US and boycott US products.
                                                Trudeau also said how him and many Canadians felt beytrayed, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. 
                                                Canada and Mexico said they will be working together against Trump's tariffs.
                                                Trump had previously floated the idea also that Canada should become the 51st state of the US.
                                                However, after negotiations, Trump agreed to pause the tariffs for 1 month due to Canada offering a $900 million border security package and a new "fentanyl czar".

                                            <li>In Jan 2025, Trump began sending deported migrant flights using military aircraft from the US to Columbia.
                                                This resulted in the Columbian President Gustavo Petro to reject the flights, saying they were inhumane.
                                                Trump reacted to this by threatening 25% tariffs on all Colombian goods coming into the U.S. (US is Colombia's largest trade partner), which would go up to 50% in one week; a travel ban and visa revocations on Colombian government officials; and emergency treasury, banking and financial sanctions.
                                                Petro announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tarrifs on US good following Trump's tariff announcement.
                                                Colombia is the fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil and also the largest supplier of fresh cut flowers to the US.
                                                Eventually, an agreement was made to transport the migrants back to Colombia on military planes, though Colombia said their presidential plane was open to be used to transport the deportees.
                                                After the agreement, Trump dropped his threats, stepping back from the brink of a trade-war.
                                                Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador.

                                                On 2/2/25, Marco Rubio told Panama President Jose Raul Mulino that the US would "take measures necessary" if Panama doesn't take steps to end what Trump sees as Chinese influence over the Panama Canal.
                                                Mulino signaled he would review agreements involving China and Chinese businesses following the talks with Rubio.
                                                Mulino also said he would consider terminating an agreement between Panama and China to contribute to China's Belt and Road initiative.
                                                Rubio said Trump thinks that China's presence - through a Hong Kong-based company operating two ports near the canal's entrances - was a threat to the waterway and a violation of the U.S.-Panama neutrality treaty.
                                                Trump commented on the Canal by saying "China's running the Panama Canal. That was not given to China, that was given to Panama - foolishly - but they violated the agreement, and we're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen."
                                                In 2021, the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings renewed a 25 year concession for operation of 2 ports at both entrances of the canal, which said could allow China to close the canal to US traffic if the US and China entered into a war.
                                                However, Panama says the ports are not part of the canal's operation and that the ports are operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.

                                                US military vessels do have priority of passage through the waterway, according the 1977 neutrality treaty, but still have to pay their toll.
                                                Marco Rubio later said in a press confrence that it was "absurd" that the US Navy pay to use the canal.

                                                In 2023, El Salvador President Nayib Bukele opened he Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) mega-prison able to hold 44,000 prisoners, in 2024 El Salvador had 110,000 prisoners in total in their country.
                                                In CECOT, there are no rehabilitation or educational programs and the prisoners are never let outside, Bukele's admin has said that the prisoners held in CECOT will never return to their communities.

                                        <ul>On Feb 1, 2025, the US military conducted airstrikes targeting a senior ISIL planner and recuits in Somalia.
                                            Hegseth said the strikes were directed by Trump and coordinated with the Somalian government.
                                            The Pentagon said that multiple ISIL operatives were killed and that no civilians were harmed in the strikes.
                                            The strikes come after previous ones on Jan 30 in northwest Syria on Hurras al-Din operatives.

                                                In Feb 2025, Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba visited Trump, in which Trump announced that $14.9 billion bid for US Steel would take the form of an investment instead of a purchase.
                                                However, sources still said Nippon had still not withdrawn their bid.
                                                Trump mistakenly referred to Nippon as "Nissan" during his remarks.
                                                Before the 2024 election, the buyout became highly politicized, with both Trump and Biden vowing to kill the deal.
                                                Biden also in Jan 2025 blocked the $14.9 billion deal from going through.

                                        In Nov 2024, Zuckerberg visited Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago club for a dinner and announced a Meta $1 million contribution to Trump's inaugural fund.
                                        Trump had previously threatened Zuckerberg with <a href="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uOazATi8RTkPgCl30ZFlLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTg5NQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/760a1612843a9b508cff394bd14e4242" target="_blank">imprisonment</a>.
                                        In Jan 2025, Meta ended its DEI program and scrapped its US fact checking program, while allowing more discussion on immigration and gender.
                                        In Jan, Meta also named prominent Republican Joel Kaplan as its chief global affairs officer and elected Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and close friend of Trump, to its board.
                                        On 1/29/2025, Meta settled a lawsuit with Trump over his banning on Meta and Facebook due to Jan 6.

                                        Musk dismissed criticism of the hand gesture as a "tired" attack.
                                        Musk made the gesture twice before saying, "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured."
                                        The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitism said in response to the gesture "It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge."
                                        Musk has backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), an anti-immigration, anti-Islamic party labeled as right-wing-extremist by German security services.

                                            <li>Since the 1980's, pilots have been rasing alarms over close calls (26 incidents in total) involving helicopters at Reagan airport.</li>
                                            <li>Immediately after the crash, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened an investigation into the cause of the collision.</li>
                                            <li>The day after the crash, Trump seemingly blamed the Black Hawk crew by saying they were flying over their altitude limit. US military helicopters normally fly a route over the Potomac River, known as Route 4, where the altitude for helicoper flights is capped at 200 feet, the Blackhawk was flying at 325 feet.</li>
                                            <li>Both Hegseth and the Army said the three-member crew of soldiers on the Black Hawk were experienced, with the designated pilot having 1000 flying hours and the other pilot having 500.</li>
                                            <li>Trump also suggested, with no evidence and while bodies were still being recovered, that DEI efforts in the FAA were the cause of the crash, then sent a memo to his admin to assess and undo any DEI initiatives in aviation safety roles.</li>
                                            <li>Trump's comments at address on the crash: "The FAA diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing," Trump said, claiming the FAA wanted people "with severe disabilities, the most underrepresented segment of the workforce, and they want them in and they want them - they can be air traffic controllers."</li>
                                            <li>After being asked how he could blame the crash on DEI despite not knowing who was at fault, Trump replied "because I have common sense."</li>
                                            <li>Trumps comments came despite there being a recording of an air traffic controller alerting the Blackhawk of the CRJ700's presence and asking the Army helicopter to pass behind the regional jet 2 minutes before the crash.</li>
                                            <li>Also on the day after the crash, Trump appointed a former senior aviation official, Chris Rocheleau, as the acting head of the FAA. The previous FAA administrator from Biden's term, Mike Whitaker, stepped down after Trump took office on Jan 20.</li>
                                            <li>At the time of the crash, the FAA was 3000 controllers under their staffing targets at 10700 controllers.</li>
                                            <li>In Feb 6, 2025, it Ted Cruz said that the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B, tracking technology on the Black Hawk was turned off at the time of the crash, Cruz is a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which received a closed-door briefing on the crash by the NTSB.</li>
