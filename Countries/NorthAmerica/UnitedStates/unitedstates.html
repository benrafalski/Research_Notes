                                        <li>Was assassinated while riding in presidental motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas</li>
                                        <li>Kennedy was in the vehicle with is wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally, and Connaly's wife Nellie</li>
                                        <li>Kennedy was shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, former US Marine, from the nearby Texas School Book Depository 250 ft away</li>
                                        <li>Kennedy was rushed to the Parkland Memorial Hospital and was pronounced dead 30 minutes after the shooting</li>
                                        <li>Two hours after the assassination, Lyndon B Johnson was hastily sworn in as president aboard Air Force One</li>
                                        <li>After the assassination, Owsald returned home and got a pistol that he used to kill Dallas policeman JD Tippit</li>
                                        <li>Oswald was eventually apprehended by Dallas police about an hour after Kennedy and Connally were shot and was charged with the murders of Kennedy and Tippit</li>
                                        <li>Two days later on 24 Nov 1963, a live TV camera showing Oswald being moved in the Dallas Police Headquarters captured Oswald being shot by Jack Ruby, Oswald died</li>
                                        <li>Ruby was convicted of murdering Oswald, but was overturned on appeal, and Ruby died in prison in 1967 awaiting a new trial</li>
                                        <li>The Warren commission spent 10 months investigating the murder and concluded Oswald assassinated Kennedy and that neither Oswald or Ruby were part of a conspiracy</li>
                                        <li>In 1967, the New Orleans district attorney Jim Garrison brought the only trial for Kennedy's murder against Clay Shaw, who was aquitted</li>
                                        <li>Further investigations also found that Oswald acted alone including the Rockefeller Commission and the Church Committee</li>
                                        <li>However, in 1979, the US House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) concluded that Kennedy was murdered as part of a conspiracy</li>
                                        <li>The HSCA said there was a high probability there were two gunmen, based on a police Dictabelt recording that was later debunked by the US DOJ</li>

                                                On May 1, 2025, Mike Waltz was forced out as National Security adviser in the first major shakeup of Trump 2.0.
                                                Rubio was named as interim replacement and Trump said he would tap Waltz to be his ambassador to the UN.
                                                Waltz's deputy, Alex Wong, an Asia expert who was a State Department official focused on North Korea during Trump's first term, is also being forced from his post.
                                                The firing came in the wake of the Signalgate scandal and a broader national security purge from the Laura Loomer list.

                                        Bessent was confirmed in a 68-29 vote with 16 Dem votes.
                                        Bessent was previously a billionaire hedge fund manager and is the first openly gay treasury secretary.
                                        He has been a strong advocate for renewing Trump's taxcuts and also his tariffs, saying they would help combat unfair trade practices, increase revenues, and bolster US leverage in international negotiations.

                                                Previously, Hegseth was a Fox News nost and a decorated veteran. 
                                                Before being sworn in, Hegseth was controversial due to him being accused in an affidavit by his former sister-in-law saying he abused his second ex-wife, him paying a women $50,000 in 2017 who accused him of sexual assault, him excessively drinking, him financially mismanaging veterans' organizations.

                                                Congress had previously passed legislation in 2021 banning the naming of bases after Confederates, which Hegseth sidestepped by naming the base after Private First Class Roland Bragg, who fought in WWII.
                                                Hegseth then did the same thing renaming Fort Moore back to its original name of Fort Benning, saying it was after WWI Corporal Fred Benning.

                                                On Mar 13, 2025, national security adviser Mike Waltz added the Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a group chat called "Houthi PC small group" in the messaging app Signal.
                                                Hegseth them proceeded to share warplans including targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing on Yemen-Houthi strikes with the groupchat.
                                                Waltz also tasked his deputy Alex Wong with setting up a "tiger team" to coordinate U.S. action against the Houthis.
                                                In the chat, JD Vance also questioned weather the US should go through with the attacks, saying Europe didn't deserve their help.
                                                In Mar 14, Gabbard tweeted "unauthorized release of classified information is a violation of the law and will be treated as such."
                                                On Mar 24, Goldberg made public that he was added to the chat.
                                                Trump responded to the security breach by saying "I don't know anything about it. I'm not a big fan of The Atlantic."
                                                On Mar 31, Karoline Leavitt said the case was closed on the incident and that steps had been taken to prevent a repeat without elaborating, despite there not being an investigation.
                                                On April 21, 2025, it was releaved that Hegseth shared detailed from the Houthi Signal group chat with his wife, brother, and personal lawyer in a seperate Signal chat.
                                                After the reports, Leavitt said that Trump stood behind Hegseth and that no classified information was shared.

                                        During her confimation hearing, Bondi vowed to maintain independence in the DOJ.
                                        However, when Trump took office he signed an EO ordering Bondi to investigate the "weaponization" of the DOJ.
                                        Bondi previously joined Trump in echoing false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election.
                                        Bondi holds stake in Trump's media company, the Trump Media and Technology Group, and was previously the Florida state attorney general.
                                        Trump had originally chosen Matt Gaetz to be AG, until Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration and resigned from Congress just before a House of Representatives ethics report found that he had paid women for sex and drugs and obstructed Congress.
                                        The Senate later confirmed (51-49) Kash Patel as FBI director, who was controvertial due to him calling for retribution aganist Trump critics, putting the independence of the FBI in jeopardy.
                                        Dan Bongino, a right-wing podcaster who has never been an FBI agent and who has called the agency "irredeemably corrupt," was named as deputy director of the FBI (which has a presicent of being a non-political position), calling into question the politicization of the organization.

                                        He was a controversial pick due to his association with the anti-vaccine movement, long saying that vaccines cause autism.
                                        Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, a doctor with decades of experience, was seen as a potential swing vote against Kennedy until Elon Musk threatened to primary him, after which he fell in line.
                                        RFK Jr said his first priority was to be transparent and remove those who had conflict of intrests from the government.

                                        Confirmed 52-48, with all Dems voting no and Mitch McConnell being only Republican to vote no.
                                        Gabbard was a former Dem Representative in the House, she became in independent in 2022 before becoming a Republican and backing Trump in 2024.
                                        She had no previous experience in intelligence agencies and had not served on any intelligence committees while in the house.
                                        Gabbard was a controversial pick due to her visiting Assad in 2017 while he was under sanctions by the US, for her statements that mirrored Russian misinformation about the Ukraine-Russia war, and for defending Edward Snowden (who she refused to call a traitor during her hearings).
                                        Gabbard was originally opposed by many Senate Republicans, until they were pressured by Trump and Musk who said they would primary them if they voted against her, this included Musk threatening to primary Senator Todd Young, an intelligence committee member who did not immediately back Gabbard.
                                        Gabbard's Director of the CIA is John Ratcliffe, a former House of Representatives member who served as Director of National Intelligence during Trump's first term.

                                        Before the vote Dems staged a marathon overnight voting session, denouncing Vought as a dangerous far-right ideologue.
                                        Vought had previously headed the OMB under Trump's first term.
                                        Vought was controversial because he criticized a 1974 impoundment law, preventing the president from unilaterally blocking congressionally approved funding, as unconstitutional.
                                        Vought also had links to the hard-right Project 2025 policy initiative, which he helped author.

                                                        The lawsuits was place in Washington DC and said "Plaintiffs reasonably fear that all or parts of this list might be published by allies of President Trump, thus placing themselves and their families in immediate danger of retribution by the now pardoned and at-large Jan. 6 convicted felons." 
                                                        Despite the lawsuits, some of those pardoned on Jan 6 took to social media to dox their prosecutors, calling for them to get fired.
                                                        On 2/6/2025, in the Washington DC US District judge taking the lawsuit orderd a pause on the public release of the FBI list until the next morning when the court hearing resumed, this was to protect the FBI agents from being doxxed.
                                                        Trump later agreed to not publicly disclose the names of the FBI employees involved in the Jan 6 investigation, Trump however did say that some of the FBI employees would be fired due to their role in the investigation.
                                                        On Mar 4, 2025, the head of the NY FBI office, James Dennehy, was forced to retire, weeks after pushing back on the Trump admin about providing the list of Jan 6 investigators.

                                                        <u>Eric Adams</u>: 
                                                        On Feb 10, 2025, the Bove directed federal prosecutors to drop all corruption charges on NY Mayor Eric Adams, saying the case was impeding his ability to aid Trump on immigration.
                                                        Bove said he didn't question the integrity of the prosecutors who brought the case and had no doubts on the merit of it but said he endorsed the idea that the charges were only brought on Adams because he critisiced Biden's immigration policy.
                                                        Bove said he wanted the charges dropped "without prejudice," so that they could possibly be revived again after the upcoming NY mayoral election amounting to an implicit threat of future prosecution if Adams didn't play ball.
                                                        Adams was federally indicted (means he most likely is guilty) in Sept 2024 for accepting bribes from Turkish officials in exchange for taking pro-Turkey actions.
                                                        Following Adams' indictment, he began forging ties with Trump, inlcuding attending his inaguration at Maralago, leading many to believe he was seeking a pardon.

                                                        <u>DOJ Adams resignations</u>
                                                        On Feb 13, 2025, in the first large controntation in the new Trump presidency, the Manhattan US Attorney, Dannielle Sassoon resigned after rejecting to comply with Bove's order to drop charges on Adams.
                                                        After Sassoon had rejected dismissing the case, Trump's admin directed John Keller, the acting head of the Justice Department's public corruption unit, to do so.
                                                        However, Keller also resigned along with Kevin Driscoll, a senior official in the department's criminal division, three other deputies in the DOJ public corruption unit also resigned.
                                                        Sassoon was picked by Trump to temporarily lead the office prosecuting Adams, she is also a member of the right-leaning Federalist Society and a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
                                                        Sassoon also said she would seek a new indictment accusing Adams of destroying evidence and directing others to do so.
                                                        Bove responded by saying that Sassoon had failed to comply with what he called his office's finding that the case against Adams amounted to "weaponization" of the justice system, saying the DOJ would "not tolerate the insubordination."
                                                        Bove said that the two trial prosecutors on Adam's case would be put on leave and his office would take over the case, moving to dismiss it.
                                                        In a letter to Bondi, Sassoon wrote that she and Bove attended a meeting on Jan 31 in which Adams' lawyers said they mayor could only enforce immigration policies if his charges were dropped, Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, denied any "quid pro quo." 
                                                        The resignations were compared to the "Saturday Night Massacre" in 1973, when senior DOJ officials resigned after refusing Nixon's order to fire the special counsel investigating break-in at the Watergate Democratic headquarters.
                                                        On April 22, 2025, the 3 remaining DOJ lawyers who brought charges against Adams resigned, saying they were pressured to admit wrongdoing by refusing to drop the case, bringing the total resignations from the case to 11.

                                                        On Feb 14, 2025, Antoinette Bacon, a supervisory official in the DOJ criminal division, and Edward Sullivan, senior litigation counsel in the public integrity section signed off on a formal request to drop Adams' case.
                                                        The decision then went to Judge Dale Ho, who scheduled a public hearing by the DOJ on why they want to drop the case.
                                                        Ho later ruled on 2/21/2025 that he would conduct a further inquiry before deciding weather to dismiss Adams' case and delayed Adam's trial (originally on 4/21/2025) indefinitely.
                                                        Ho appointed an independent lawyer, former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement (who is conservative), to assist him in making a final ruling.
                                                        On Feb 20, 2025, the NY Governor Kathy Hochul, said she would not remove Adams from office, but instead would just create a new inspector general for the mayor's office.
                                                        On Feb 26, 2025, Adams' lawyer Alex Spiro asked Ho to dismiss the charges with prejudice, meaning the DOJ could not bring them up again.
                                                        Spiro said in the filing that due to Sassoon's letter being leaked, Adams' would never get a fair trial so the charges must be dropped permanently.
                                                        On April 2, 2025, Judge Ho dismissed Adams' charged with prejudice (they can't be brought again), in his ruling he said "Everything here smacks of a bargain: dismissal of the Indictment in exchange for immigration policy concessions."

                                                        Buma was accused of printing 130 internal FBI files in 2023 and sharing them with associates as part of a book he was writing about his career.

                                                        On April 25, 2025, the DOJ began allowing prosecutors in criminal investigations to use subpoenas, court orders and search warrants to compel "production of information and testimony by and relating to members of the news media."
                                                        The directive reverses a Biden DOJ policy that barred prosecutors from seizing reporters' phone and email records in most circumstances, following criticism of the DOJ for secretly subpoenaing records on reporters and congressional staff members as prosecutors pursued leaks of national security information during Trump's first term.
                                                        Some of the most consequential reporting in U.S. history — from Watergate to warrantless wiretapping after 9/11 — was and continues to be made possible because reporters have been able to protect the identities of confidential sources.
                                                        The move came when Trump repeatedly said he was pursuing a policy of "radical transparency."
                                                        On April 28, 2025, the FBI said they would begin using polygraph tests to investigate the source of leaks.

                                                        This executive order also reclassified Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, which Biden had rescinded on Jan 14, 2025 with the accompaniment of Cuba agreeing to free more than 500 prisoners from its jails.

                                                        In Dec 2024, GEC's mandate (from Obama 2016 EO) expired and was reorganized into the R/FIMI.
                                                        The office had an annual budget of $61 mln and was played an important role in combating Russian and Chinese disinformation.
                                                        However, Republicans have long complained that the office disfavored and censored conserviate media.
                                                        In Dec 2023, Texas AG Ken Paxton, Daily Wire and The Federalist sued GEC for allegedly censoring their speech online.

                                                        The USDS will be responsible for "implementing the President's DOGE Agenda" or shrinking of the government.
                                                        The USDS will also be responsible for improving the quality of governmentwide software under the Software Modernization Initiative.
                                                        Under this EO DOGE is only mandated to modernize federal technology and software "to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity," other orders on hiring freezes and recruitment say DOGE should work with other agencies to make recommendations, but Musk and his aides used DOGE for much more than just recommendations.

                                                        After Trump took office, at least 3 federal lawsuit were filed saying DOGE violated federal law by operating before Trump took office and not offering their records to the public.        
                                                        On Feb 13, 2025, the US State Department announced they planned to buy $400 million worth of armored electric vehicled from Tesla (which are not the best armoured vehicles due to them having to be armoured after the fact).
                                                        The armoured EV deal had previously been negotiated under Biden but was only worth $483,000 for the EVs and $3 million for supporting equipment, less than 1% of what the Trump deal was worth.
                                                        On Feb 20, 2025 DOGE fired 3 of the 7 workers from the US auto safety agency unit overseeing the safety of autonomous vehicles (some were later rehired).

                                                        In trump's election win, Musk spent $250 mln to his campaign and gave checks to voters who aligned with Trump.
                                                        Musk also gave two $1 mln checks to voters who voted to help elect conservative Brad Schimel in the Mar 2025 Wisconsin state Supreme Court elections.
                                                        On 2/3/2025, Trump made Elon a "special government employee," potentially allowing him avoid disclosure rules about conflicts of interest and finances that apply to regular government employees.
                                                        As a special government employee, Musk does not get paid and is only allowed to work for 130 days in a year and is not subject to the same conflict-of-intrest and ethics rules as federal employees.
                                                        In late Feb 2025, the WH said in a court filing that Musk was not the head of DOGE and had no cost-cutting authority but was just an adviser to Trump, which Trump later contradicted saying Musk was the leader of DOGE.
                                                        On Feb 25, 2025, the WH said a little known former healthcare technology consultant named Amy Gleason, was the acting head of DOGE, she previously worked for the US Digital Service under Trump's first term.

                                                        On the 2/1/25, Musk and his DOGE team, took access of the US Treasury Department's payment system after a days-long standoff with career Treasury official, David Lebryk, and ended with Lebryk being placed on leave then retiring.
                                                        With access to the payment system, Musk gained access to Social Security and Medicare benefits, grants, payments to government contractors, including those that compete directly with Musk's own companies.
                                                        After the takeover, Musk posted with no evidence to X that the Treasury Department had been instructed to approve payments to "known fraudulent or terrorist groups." 
                                                        On Feb 4, 2025, the Treasury said that the DOGE team had been granted "read-only access" to its payment system codes but denied that this cut off any government payments including for Social Security or Medicare.
                                                        On Feb 14, 2025, the Treasury Department's inspector general said it was beginning an audit of security controls for their payment systems.
                                                        The announcement came after a group of Dem senators expressed concerns after DOGE was given access to the payment systems.
                                                        On Feb 17, 2025, the acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration Michelle King resigned, after clashing with DOGE over its bid to access Social Security records.
                                                        On Feb 20, 2025, the White House and the Treasury agreed to prohibit DOGE from accessing personal info of taxpayers from the IRS.
                                                        The agreement prevented a DOGE aide, 25-year-old software engineer Gavin Kliger, from accessing individual taxpayer returns or other personal information

                                                        On 2/1/2025, Musk aides at the US Office of Personnel Management (OPM) locked career civil servants out of computer systems that contain the personal data of millions of federal employees, making it so that the public has no visibility into what the OPM was doing on the systems.
                                                        Days after Trump took office, DOGE officials were granted admin access to all OPM computer systems.
                                                        With admin access, DOGE has access to a database called Enterprise Human Resources Integration, which contains dates of birth, Social Security numbers, appraisals, home addresses, pay grades and length of service of government workers.
                                                        The OPM was filled with former Musk employees after Trump took office, including software engineers and SpaceX VP of HR Brian Bjelde, upon which they moved sofa beds into the OPM headquarters to "work around the clock"        
                                                        On 2/6/25, DOGE agents accessed highly restricted OPM record on millions of federal employees, including those working at the Treasury and State department in sensitive security positions.
                                                        The White House said that the DOGE team all have the proper security clearances and are not breaking the law and that all Musk actions are first approved by Trump, they said looking at org charts is a part of any restructuring.

                                                        CMS said in a statement that they had 2 senior agency veterans, one focused on policy and one focused on operations, working with the DOGE team to ensure appropriate access 
                                                        In response to the report that DOGE was working with CMS, Musk - without providing evidence - posted "this is where the big money fraud is happening,"
                                                        The report on the DOGE workers said Musk allied have not been given access to databases that include identifiable personal health information of Medicare or Medicaid enrollees and that DOGE's access is "read-only".

                                                        After the creation of DOGE, Musk relied on about a dozen young tech engineers with little government experience to takeover the agency.
                                                        These engineers include Gavin Klinger, Luke Farritor, and Edward Coristine.  
                                                        Gavin Klinger is a Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Major grad from Berkeley in 2020, he was previously a senior Software Engineer at San Francisco, California-based AI Startup Databrinks, he also has a substack where he wrote an article "the Curious Case of Matt Gaetz: How the Deep State Destroys its Enemies"; Klinger was later found to have retweeted post from Nick Fuentes and Andrew Tate in the past.  
                                                        Luke Forritor is a former intern at SpaceX, where he worked 10 hour days writing software for rocket fuel parts, he graduated from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a CS major, he was previously part of an award-winning team that deciphered portions of an ancient Greek scroll.
                                                        Edward Coristine is only a highschool grad having been enrolled at Northeastern University, he previously spent 3 weeks at Musk's Neuralink last summer, he also previously created 3 tech firms in Connecticut that are valued at $2.4 million by Zillow; it was later disclosed that Coristine had been fired from his previous job at Path Network amid a leaking investigation.
                                                        In Mar 2025, it was revealed that Coristine (also called "bigballs"), had ran a network company called DiamondCDN that provided services to cybercriminal group "EGodly,"
                                                        On 2/6/25, one of engineers, Marko Elez, resigned from DOGE after he was linked to a deleted social-media account that advocated racism and eugenics.
                                                        In April 2025, it was revealed that Christopher Stanley, a former engineer for X and SpaceX, and became a senior advisor in the Deputy Attorney General's office, had previously ran sites that distributed pirated ebooks, bootleg software and video game cheats.
                                                        After Stanely's past was reported by Reuters, his old sites were scrubbed from the Internet Archive, despite DOGE claiming they are for "radical transparency."

                                                        Later, two other judges refused to block DOGE from accessing systems at HHS and the CFPB.
                                                        On 2/8/2025, a Manhattan US District judge temporarily blocked (later extended twice) Musk's DOGE team from accessing Treasury dept systems, following a lawsuit by a coalition of mostly Dem-led states saying DOGE had no legal right to access the systems.
                                                        The judge later clarified that the order didn't apply to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, only the DOGE team after Musk complained saying the order included blocking Bessent in a bid to have it revoked.
                                                        In response to the blocking of Treasury data, Elon tweeted "absolutely insane!"
                                                        Musk said that the Treasury Department and DOGE had agreed to require all outgoing government payments to include a rationale in the form of a comment and to have a categorization code; he also said that a do-not-pay list of entities that should not receive government payments should be updated at least weekly, if not daily.

                                                                They also fired 90% of the CFPB staff (1500 people cut, 200 remain) that same day.

                                                        On Mar 10, 2025 US District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington ordered Musk's DOGE to make public records concerning its operations, which he said had been run in "unusual secrecy." 
                                                        Trump's team had argued that DOGE should be exempt from FOIA requests, which Cooper disagreed with due to DOGE exercising "substantial independent authority" much greater than the other components of the Executive Office that are usually exempt from FOIA.
                                                        On Mar 13, 2025, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled in a seperate lawsuit ordering DOGE to disclose, during the process of discovery, how it was making cost-cutting decisions and how far they could go. 
                                                        Chutkan's order was paused by an appeals court on Mar 26, 2025.

                                                        On Mar 19, 2025, US District Judge Beryl Howell allowed Musk and DOGE to take over the US Institute of Peace (USIP).
                                                        The emergency ruling came after DOGE gained access using armed police to the USIP, an independent, nonprofit organization funded by Congress.
                                                        Howell strongly criticized how DOGE had entered the building but said she was not going issue a TRO.
                                                        DOGE had a standoff on 3/17/25 in which a handful of USIP staff locked the doors to the building, after which DOGE and the local police, expelled the USIP's president, several staffers, and an attorney from the building.
                                                        Trump subsequently fired the USIP president and installed a loyalist to replace him.
                                                        Trump had also previously fired most of the USIP board on March 14, which they claimed was unlawful due to Trump not giving a reason for the terminations.

                                                        On Mar 20, 2025, US District Judge Ellen Lipton Hollander of Maryland said the Social Security Admin likely violated privacy laws by giving DOGE "unbridled access" to SSA data for millions of Americans, and ordered a halt to further record sharing.
                                                        Hollander said that the DOGE team of 10 staffers were on a fishing expedition at the SAA.
                                                        Hollander also (ironically) noted that DOGE staffers had been granted anonymity in the proceeding due to fears for their safety.
                                                        On Mar 22, 2025, SSA head, Leland Dudek (Musk ally), backed down from "shutting down the agency," after Hollander rebuked him for his comments to the media that the order would require him also to restrict access to the information for agency employees, which would effectively shut the agency down.  
                                                        On April 17, 2025, Hollander's TRO expired and she issued a preliminary injunction for the remainder of the case, blocking DOGE from accessing any SSA data that contained personal information.
                                                        On April 30, 2025, a 4th Circuit appeals court ruled 9-6 declining to block Hollander's injunction.

                                                        At the SSA, lawyers, statisticians and other high-ranking agency officials are being sent from the Baltimore headquarters to regional offices to replace veteran claims processors who have been fired or taken buyouts, resulting in longer wait times for the disabled and elderly.
                                                        SSA computer systems also take longer to come back up, due to most of the IT staff having quit or been fired.
                                                        At the IRS, the internet has become so patchy since Trump ordered remote workers back to overcrowded offices that staff are resorting to personal hotspots, resulting in crashing computers.
                                                        These are just 2 of 20 instances where the staff and funding cuts led to purchasing bottlenecks and increased costs; paralysis in decision-making; longer public wait times; higher-paid civil servants filling in menial jobs, and a brain drain of scientific and technological talent.
                                                        Another example is National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health scientists having to wait a month for dry ice shipments, which they used to by at the supermarket but can't anymore due to Musk cancelling all government credit cards.
                                                        DOGE also banned agancies from communicating with outside vendors, causing a $500,000 piece of CDC chemical equipment to sit idle for months.
                                                        DOGE also largely shut down USAID, canceling more than 80% of its humanitarian programs.
                                                        In total, 260,000 employees have been resigned, taken buyout offers, or been fired by DOGE.
                                                        DOGE also fired government employees who were already looking into government efficiency, including the 17 inspector generals and the 90 member 18-F team, which saved the Pentagon $500 million over a single 3-day project.
                                                        Musk's 5-things email had also become obsolte by the 100 day mark, with most agencies stopping them due to it being a waste of time.

                                                        On April 23, 2025, Musk said he was reducing his time commitment to government work and going back to his companies.
                                                        After Musk's departure, agency heads are likely to reassert control over budgets and staffing from DOGE.

                                                        The MCC had an annual budget of $900 million, and partners with developing countries on projects like improving electricity supply for businesses and improving roads for farmers to get their goods to market.
                                                        DOGE ordered the halting of all MCC projects including a wastewater treatment plant in Mongolia, electrical power grids in Senegal and Nepal, and schools in Ivory Coast.

                                                        Trump's DHS said Biden's numbers were "artificially high" because of higher levels of illegal immigration during Biden's last year, making them easier to deport.
                                                        Due to the failure to increase deportations, the acting director of ICE, Caleb Vitello, was reassigned.
                                                        Trump also later fired Mellissa Harper, the acting director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, responsible for overseeing the care of unaccompanied migrant children. 
                                                        On April 27, 2025, the DEA made their largest arrest yet, arresting 114 illegal immigrants in a night club in Colorado Springs.

                                                        <u>Alien Enemies Act</u>: 
                                                        On Mar 15, 2025 Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 against Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, saying the United States was facing an "invasion." 
                                                        Under Trump's proclamation, all Venezuelan citizens 14+ years of age and determined to be members of the gang and are in the US illegally, are subject to the Alien Enemies act.
                                                        The Alien Enemies Act is best known for its use to justify internment camps for people of Japanese, German and Italian descent during WW2.
                                                        Hours later, a US District Judge, James Boasberg, issued a TRO blocking the deportations for 14 days (later extended to April 12), saying the act "does not provide a basis for the president's proclamation given that the terms invasion, predatory incursion really relate to hostile acts perpetrated by any nation and commensurate to war."
                                                        The ACLU had previously sued Trump for the 5 Venezualan deportations, saying they had been misidentified as being part of Tren de Aragua.
                                                        On April 18, 2025, a classified assessment from the National Intelligence Council that drew from 18 intelligence agencies repeatedly stated that TdA is not coordinated with or supported by Maduro or senior Venezualean officials.
                                                        However, the report did find that TdA had minimal contact with low-level members of the Venezualean government.
                                                        Of the 18 agencies involved, only the FBI disagreed, saying they thought Maduro was "likely" weaponizing TdA against the US.
                                                        On May 1, 2025, US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez in Texas ruled that Trump cannot use the AEA to deport Venezuelans, since the law was not intended to be used in peacetime and thet TdA didn't amount to an invasion.
                                                        On May 13, 2025, US District Judge Stephanie Haines, ruled that Trump has authority to declare the TdA a foreign terrorist organization and deport its members under the AEA, but said Trump must give the deported 21 days notice and a chance to challenge if they are a gang member.

                                                        On Mar 16, 2025, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said that 238 alleged members of the Tren de Aragua had arrived to the Terrorism Confinement Center mega-prison.
                                                        CECOT is notorious for its poor conditions, including overcrowding, overheating, torture, beatings, strangulation, and lack of medical attention.
                                                        The deportations came despite Boasberg's TRO from the day before, where he said any deportation flights that had already taken off should turn arround and come back to the US.
                                                        "Oopsie...Too late," Bukele posted in response to an article about the TRO blocking the deportations, adding a laughing emoji.
                                                        The day before, Trump had agreed to pay El Salvador $6 million to imprison 300 alleged members of Tren de Aragua for one year.
                                                        WH press secretary Karoline Leavitt said "A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft ... full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from U.S. soil."
                                                        Border czar Tom Homan later told Fox & Friends "Another flight, another flight every day," adding: "We're not stopping. I don't care what the judges think." 
                                                        Trump said on Truth Social "I'm just doing what the VOTERS wanted me to do," and "This judge, like many of the Crooked Judges' I am forced to appear before, should be IMPEACHED."
                                                        Trump's comments caused Chief Justice Roberts to publicly rebuke Trump, "For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision."

                                                        Another deportee was Andry Hernandez, a gay make-up artist who ICE alleged TdA gang membership based on his crown tattoos, one on each wrist for his mom and dad.

                                                        <u>Kilmar Abrego Garcia</u>: 
                                                        In March 2025, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who had no criminal record in the US or in El Salvador, was deported to CECOT by Trump.
                                                        In 2019, Abrego Garcia was arrested while trying to get day labor outside of a Home Depot, upon which a deportation judge denied him asylum (due a technicality of him missing the 1 year deadline) but instead issued a withholding of removal order protecting him from deportation to El Salvador because there was enough evidence he could be persecuted by the Barrio 18 gang (which he fled from in 2006) if returned home, the Trump admin later said his deportation was an "administrative error".
                                                        The Trump admin repeadedly claimed Abrego Garcia was an MS-13 member (despite not deporting him during Trump's first term), with the only evidence from a form filled out by the Prince George County Police Department, saying that "he was wearing a Chicago Bulls hat and a hoodie; and that a confidential informant advised that he was an active member of MS-13 with the Westerns clique", a group based out of Long Island (Kilmar has never been to NY).
                                                        On April 5, 2025, US District Judge Paula Xinis ruled that the goverment must "facilitate and effecuate" Garcia's return to the US by April 7, upon which Pam Bondi fired the DOJ prosecutor working on the case (the one who admitted to the "administrative error").
                                                        On April 7, ahead of the deadline, Chief Justice Roberts issued a stay on Xinis' order while they considered the case, after an appeals court refused to pause the TRO for Trump. 
                                                        On April 10, the Supreme Court ruled that Xinis' order "properly requires the government to 'facilitate' Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador," however, they said the term "effecuate" was vague, upon which Xinis dropped the word and only required the government to "facilitate" the return.
                                                        In their ruling, the SC ruled against Trump in that the US had jurisdiction over the case and that the deportation of Abrego Garcia was unlawful, they also said that Trump must facilitate his return while saying effecuate was vague so Xinis dropped effecuate and changed her TRO to just say facilitate.
                                                        On April 11, Xinis ordered Trump to give daily updates on the status of Abrego Garcia, saying the Trump admin has "done nothing to facilitate the return of Mr. Abrego Garcia." 
                                                        In the coming days, the Trump admin said he Abrego Garcia was "alive and secure" but that SC's order to "facilitate" the return of him meant they should only "remove any domestic obstacles that would otherwise impede the alien's ability to return here."
                                                        On April 24, 2025, Trump met with El Salvador president Bukele, during the visit, Bukele said he would not return Abrego Garcia and Trump said he would not ask for him back, with both justifying saying Abrego Garcia was in MS-13.
                                                        During the meeting, Pam Bondi said that "facilitate" meant they would just provide a plane if Bukele wanted to return Abrego Garcia to the US, she also claimed Kilmar had been given a deportation order twice, when he had never been given one.
                                                        Bukele said he would not return Kilmar since that would be like smuggling a terrorist to the US.
                                                        On April 15, 2025, Xinis ordered DHS and ICE officials to testify under oath about what they were doing to get Abrego Garcia back.
                                                        In the order Xinis said "To date, what the record shows is that nothing has been done (to get Abrego Garcia back). Nothing." 
                                                        She stopped short of ordering Trump to ask El Salvador outright to return Abrego Garcia but said their refusal to do so was "stunning."
                                                        On April 16, 2025, Dem Senator Chris Van Hollen travelled to El Salvador in an attempt to talk to Abrego Garcia but was denied access by the El Salvador's Vice President Felix Ulloa, who also said they were not releasing Abrego Garcia because the US paying to keep him incarcerated.
                                                        In a reversal, on April 17, 2025, Van Hollen was allowed to meet with Abrego Garcia at a hotel, confirming he was healthy, Abrego Garcia also said he had been moved from CECOT to a better detention facility 8 days before the meeting.
                                                        Also on April 17, 2025, an appeals court rejected Trumps bid to halt Xinis' TRO and also rejected his bid to prevent Xinis from probing if the Trump admin was in contempt for not returning Kilmar.
                                                        On April 21, 2025, U.S. House Rep Maxwell Frost of Florida, Robert Garcia of California, Yassamin Ansari of Arizona and Maxine Dexter of Oregon travelled to El Salvador to try and facilitate Abrego Garcia's return but were denied access to Abrego Garcia by the Salvadorian government.

                                                        Gallagher in her ruling said that Trump must facilitate Chandler's return, after having sent him to CECOT.

                                                        Boasberg later set a deadline for 3/20/25 for Trump to respond to a judicial request for more details on the deportations to determine if they were against his TRO.
                                                        On the Mar 20 deadline, Boasenberg said Trump's defense team's response to his request for more details was "woefully insufficient," saying they had till 3/25 to justify why their failure to bring back the deported migrants did not violate his order.
                                                        The Trump admin had failed to meet the deadline to respond with details, saying they were deciding if they should use the state secrets doctrine, which protects sensitive national security info from being disclosed in civil litigation, despite Rubio tweeting the flight details.

                                                        On Mar 24, 2025, Boasberg ruled that migrants Trump tried to deport under the Alien Enemies Act must be given the chance to challenge the government's assertion that they are indeed members of Tren de Aragua.
                                                        In the same ruling, Boasberg rejected Trump's bid to have his TRO on the deportation ban under the AEA halted.
                                                        The Trump defense proceeded to invoke the state secrets privilege to allow them to withold information from the court proceedings.
                                                        When Trump appealed Boasberg's TRO, U.S. Circuit Judge Patricia Millett said Nazis during WW2 were given more rights than the Vanezualans did under Trump, the appeals court went on to reject Trump's appeal.

                                                        On Mar 28, 2025, US District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston issued a nationwide TRO designed to protect migrants subject to final orders of removal from being swiftly deported to countries other than those that had already been identified during immigration proceedings.
                                                        The National Immigration Litigation Alliance brought the case against Trump after ICE began using a fast-tracked deportation system.
                                                        Murphy said that under the Convention Against Torture, migrants had protections against being removed to countries where they face a likelihood of torture.
                                                        On April 7, 2025, an appeals court rejected Trump's bid to have Murphy's TRO lifted, saying that such an order generally cannot be appealed, unlike longer-term preliminary injunctions.
                                                        On April 18, Murphy issued a preliminary injunction, barring Trump from conducting final order deportations without giving the deportees asylum hearings to ensure they would not be tortured or killed.

                                                        On Mar 31, 2025, US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco paused a DHS decision to remove temporary protected status (TPS) for Venezualans.
                                                        In 2021, Biden granted TPS to Venezuelans, citing high levels of crime in Venezuela due to instbaility from Maduro.
                                                        600,000 Venezualans in the US have TPS, the ruling protects 348,000 of them.
                                                        In the ruling, Chen said "Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes."
                                                        Venezuelan TPS holders are more likely to hold bachelor's degrees than U.S. citizens and less likely to commit crimes than the general U.S. population.
                                                        On April 18, 2025, Trump's appeal of Chen's ruling was rejected, due to the Trump admin not showing it would suffer irreparable harm from the TRO.

                                                        On April 7, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 (Barrett joined the Libs) to lift Boasberg's TRO from Mar 15.
                                                        However, the majority still ruled that detainees "must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs."
                                                        Habeas corpus relief is the right of detainees to challenge the legality of their detention and is considered a bedrock right under U.S. law.
                                                        The court said the "proper venue" was in the place they where the detainees were located, which would be in Texas no DC.
                                                        The court also told Boasberg that he no longer has jurisdiction in the matter, should drop the case and should deny the preliminary injunction request by the migrants.

                                                        After the Supreme Court rulings, the ACLU quickly refiled in Brownsville, Texas, and Manhattan to bar Alien Enemies Act deportations.
                                                        On April 9, 2025 Texas US District Judge Fernando Rodriguez and NY US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein both blocked any further AEA deportations, saying they required due process first.
                                                        On April 19, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the ACLU (only Thomas and Alito dessented) and temporarily barred Trump from deporting Venezualans due to reports that Trump was continuing deportations without due process.
                                                        Their ruling read, "The Government is directed not to remove any member of the putative class of detainees from the United States until further order of this Court." 
                                                        ACLU lawyers made an urgent filing with the Supreme Court after failing to get a rapid response from filings on with US District Judge James Hendrix in Texas, and the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
                                                        In Alito's dissent, he criticized the court majority for "hastily and prematurely" blocking Trump. 
                                                        On April 12, 2025, Hellerstein extended his TRO saying Trump must notify Venezuelans 10 days in advance before deporting them, and US District Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Denver ruled that Trump must notify Venezuealan detainees 21 days in advance and inform them of their due process rights.

                                                        The new CBP Home app allowed illegal immigrants to "self deport" rather than face possible arrest and detention.

                                                        Biden had previously granted to the migrants parole, allowing them to enter the country by air if they had U.S. sponsors.

                                                        Their evidence was that they "observed indicia of MS-13 association" while searching Villatoro's bedroom."

                                                        After Trump took office he began revoking the rights of thousands of student visa holders to remain in the U.S.
                                                        Trump did this by revoking the students' status by removing them from the SEVIS database of the approximately 1.1 million foreign student visa holders.
                                                        To remain in the database, visa holders have to obey conditions like limits on employment and avoiding illegal activity (by statute, criminal activity is defined as convictions of violent crimes for which a sentence of more than one year could be imposed).
                                                        Despite this, Trump had deleted more than 4700 students from the database (as of April 2025), resulting in dozens of judge orders halting his moves due to the students either having no criminal history or having misdemeanors.
                                                        The revokations, risked scaring off foreign students who are a source of global talent that contributed $44 billion to the U.S. economy in 2024.
                                                        On April 25, 2025, Trump reversed and began restoring visas folowing over 200 legal wins by the foreign students.

                                                        The said she hindered ICE agents trying arrest Eduardo Flores-Ruiz without a judicial warrant outside her courtroom on April 18, and that she tried to help him evade arrest by allowing him to exit through a jury door.
                                                        Flores-Ruiz was later arrested outside the courthouse after he left with his lawyer.
                                                        Earlier in the week, the FBI also arrested a former New Mexico judge, Joel Cano, and his wife, charging them with evidence tampering, after a man who authorities allege was linked to a Venezuelan street gang was found living on their property.
                                                        Cano was later barred by the NM Supreme Court from serving as a judge.
                                                        On April 29, 2025, the Wisconsin Supreme Court temporarily suspended Dugan from being a judge due to the charges.
                                                        On May 13, 2025, Dugan was indicted by a federal grand jury on Tuesday on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction of proceedings, she plead not guilty, seeking to have the case dismissed.

                                                        On May 7, 2025, US District Judge Brian Murphy issued an order restricting Trump from deporting migrants to Libya, despite Libya's harsh treatment of detainees.
                                                        Murphy said the deportations would clearly violate a prior court order barring officials from swiftly deporting migrants to countries other than their own without first weighing whether they risk persecution or torture if sent there.
                                                        When asked about the deportations, Trump said he didn't know anything about them, "You'll have to ask Homeland Security."
                                                        Libya's Government of National Unity said it rejected the use of Libyan territory as a destination for deporting migrants without its knowledge or consent and there was no coordination with the US on the issue. 
                                                        Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army, which controls eastern Libya, also rejected the idea.

                                                        Baraka was arrested in a scuffle at the gate to the ICE facility.

                                                        The Paris Agreement is aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 F (1.5 C) above pre-industrial levels or, failing that, keeping temperatures at least well below 3.6 F (2 C) above pre-industrial levels (the world is currently at 2.3 F/1.3 C). 
                                                        Trump previously left the Paris Agreement in 2017 during his first term.

                                                        Trump said the US could return if the WHO is "cleaned up", without providing details, and that if an American was places in charge of the organization when the current WHO director's term ends.

                                                        <u>Executive Order</u>: 
                                                        Reinstated a previous Trump executive order 13957, also known as Schedule F. 
                                                        Schedule F allows Trump to reclassify federal workers' job status, in order to make it easier to fire them. 
                                                        The order order creates a new, much larger category of federal employees called "Schedule Policy/Career" who do not have the typical protections enjoyed by civil servants and can be fired at will. 
                                                        Also revoked a Biden executive order 14003 about protecting federal workers. 
                                                        Schedule F has its origins from the "unitary executive theory" that originated under Reagan during Iran-contra.
                                                        Unitive executive theory says that president could fire officers in the executive branch at will, without any restraint from Congress.

                                                        On Feb 15, 2025, Trump's appeal to the temporary restraining order was rejected upon which Trump's DOJ asked the Supreme Court to lift the order to allow Trump to fire Dellinger.
                                                        On Feb 21, 2025, the Supreme Court declined to let Trump immediately fire Dellinger.
                                                        On Feb 25, 2025, 6 federal probationary workers that had been fired by DOGE earlier in the month (20,000 had been fired), had their jobs reinstated at the request of Dellinger, who said the employees had been fired illegally.
                                                        On Mar 1, 2025, District Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that Trump's firing of Dellinger was illegal and that allowing the firing to go through would give him "a constitutional license to bully officials in the executive branch into doing his will."
                                                        On Mar 5, 2025 Dellinger was removed from his post after the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit temporarily paused the previous order that reinstated him.

                                                        Wilcox later sued Trump, saying federal law that allows a president to oust a board member only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office under the Supreme Court ruling from the 1935 umphrey's Executor v. United States case.

                                                        On 2/3/2025, Trump named Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as acting director of the CFPB, upon which he halted almost all CFPB activities including investigations, litigation, rulemaking and public communications.        
                                                        On 2/6/2025, Trump attempted to fire Federal Election Commission (FEC) Commissioner and Chair Ellen Weintraub, but she refused, saying that Trump was not firing her in a legal manner.

                                                        <u>Cathy Harris</u>: 
                                                        On Feb 18, 2025, a Washington district judge issued a TRO preventing Trump from firing Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board after she alleged Trump illegally fired her.
                                                        The Merit Systems Protection Board is a three-member board that rules on reinstating workers who feel they have been fired incorrectly.
                                                        The law that created the board allows members to be removed only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."
                                                        On Mar 4, 2025, District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Trump illegally fired Harris and she was reinstated, also saying the agency's "mission and purpose require independence."
                                                        On Mar 28, 2025, Contreras' ruling was overturned by an appeals court, saying the laws passed by Congress sheilding federal workers from being fired encroached on the president's power.
                                                        On April 7, 2025, another appeals court ruled 7-4 to reinstate the TRO requiring Harris to be reinstated, saying the previous appeal court ruling had ignored Supreme Court precedent on the issue.
                                                        On April 9, 2025, Chief Justice John Roberts issued a stay on the TRO while they considered weather to block it.

                                                        On Feb 21, 2025, Trump fired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General C.Q. Brown, in an unprecedented move.
                                                        The chairman is meant to be apolitical and serve between multiple presidents, Brown's term was to end in 2027.
                                                        Hegseth previously questioned if Brown would have gotten the position if he were not black.
                                                        He also fired the head of the Navy and air force vice chief of staff Admiral Lisa Franchetti.
                                                        In a suprise pick, Trump chose Dan Caine, a retired 3 star general, to be the next chairman; Caine was confimed by the Senate in a 60-25 vote in April 2025.
                                                        On 2/27/2025, William Perry, Leon Panetta, Chuck Hagel, Lloyd Austin, and Beyond Mattis, all former defense secretaries, signed a scathing letter criticizing Trump's firing of Brown, saying he was making the military a political arm, and called for Congress not to confirm Dan Caine.
                                                        On Feb 28, 2025, US Army Lieutenant General Telita Crosland, the head of the military's Defense Health Agency and one of the most senior Black female officers in the Army was forced to retire by the Trump admin after 32 years of service.
                                                        On May 5, 2025, Hegseth further ordered a 25% reduction in four-star officers at the Pentagon.

                                                        The decision gives the FLRA a 2-1 Democratic majority until her term expires in July.

                                                        Haugh was not present in the leaked Signal group chat and was fired without explanation.
                                                        Haugh's firing came a day after Laura Loomer met with Trump with a list of national security staff whom she said were disloyal.
                                                        After Haugh's firing, Loomer denounced Haugh as "HAND PICKED by General Milley," Milley previously called Trump a "wannabe dictator."   
                                                        In April 7, 2025, U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Shoshana Chatfield, who holds a senior position in NATO, was also fired by Trump in his growing national security purge.

                                                        Hayden was appointed under Obama for a 10-year term and had Senate confirmation.

                                                        Includes prominent names like ames Clapper, the director of national intelligence under Obama, John Brennan and Leon Panetta, who both served as CIA director under Obama, and John Bolton, who resigned as Trump's national security adviser during his first term. 
                                                        Bolton was given a protective Secret Service detail after Iran threatened to assassinate him.
                                                        It is unclear if any of those on the list still maintained a security clearance, with the EO mainly serving as a public policy message to Trump's right-wing base

                                                        The order came after a previous Murphy order that Venezuelans must get due process before being shipped to El Salvador's CECOT, Trump tried to skirt this by sending the Venezuealans to Guantanamo then El Salvador to bypass giving them any due process.

                                                        Trump did this to allow troops to detain any trespassers, including migrants, to get around a federal law that prohibits U.S. troops from being used in domestic law enforcement on American soil.
                                                        During Trump's first term, he made a similar move with 560 arces of land in order to build some of his border wall.

                                                        The ruling narrowed Whitehead's ruling, to allow Trump to freeze new refugee admissions, ones from before the EO must still be carried out.

                                                        <u>Iraqi refugee deported</u>: 
                                                        On April 24, 2025, the US deported Omar Abdulsattar Ameen to Rwanda.
                                                        Ameen was granted US refugee status in 2014 and had denied Iraqi government claims that he was an ISIL member who killed a police officer.
                                                        In 2021, a judge found that the case against Ameen for the murder were "no plausible" due to him being in Turkey at the time of the murder but both Biden and Trump pursued his removal from the US, saying he lied on his refugee application by saying he had never interacted with ISIL.
                                                        Rwanda has positioned itself as a destination country for migrants that Western countries would like to remove.

                                                        A day after the EO, 22 Dem-led states, the District of Columbia, and the city if San Fransisco sued Trump in Boston and Seattle and the American Civil Liberties Union immigrant organization also filed seperate lawsuits, both of which said Trump's order violated the 14th amendment.  
                                                        On 1/23/25, a Seattle US District judge, John Coughenour, blocked the order from being enforces for 14 days while the judge considers a long-term ruling. 
                                                        Coughenour said the order was "blatantly unconstitutional," referring to the 14th amendment that says any person born in the US is a citizen under the Citizenship Clause.  
                                                        On 2/6/2025, Coughenour extended his order, setting a nationwide injunction, saying Trump was ignoring the rule of law.
                                                        Trump later appealed the order but was denied on Feb 19, 2025.
                                                        Opponents of birthright citizenship say that if the drafters of the 14th amendment wanted all people born in the US to be citizens they would not have said that citizens "be subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.
                                                        They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and, by implication, their children.
                                                        However, most scholars dismiss the interpretation, since people in the country illegally are still subject to the laws of the US and are thus "subject to the jurisdiction" of the US.

                                                        Despite the US having record energy production and being the largest producer of energy of any nation in history, Trump felt the need to declare a national energy emergency.
                                                        The order allows oil expansion through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allow the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.
                                                        On Feb 3, 2025, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum signed 6 orders in line with Trump's EO, Burgum's orders directed agency staff to identify emergency and legal authorities to speed project development and permitting, saying that it would eliminate at least 10 regulations for every new one introduced.

                                                        The emergency permit allowed the projects to speed through an environmental review that would enable them to be built through wetlands.
                                                        Among the permit applications included Enbridge's controversial Line 5 oil pipeline under Lake Michigan, natural gas power plants, transmission lines, mining and other infrastructure projects.

                                                        This included that they would narrow the definition of waterways that receive protection under the Clean Water Act - a move that could ease limits on runoff pollution from agriculture, mining, and petrochemicals.
                                                        Zeldin also said he would review Biden-era clean power plant rule that seeks to reduce carbon emissions from power plants to fight global warming and would also roll back greenhouse gas emissions standards for heavy- and light-duty vehicles for model year 2027 and later.
                                                        The EPA also said it will take steps to undo a scientific finding from 2009 that greenhouse gas emissions endanger public health, a provision that forms the bedrock of the EPA's greenhouse-gas regulations so far, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act codified language deeming greenhouse gases are air pollutants.
                                                        The "endangerment finding" came as a result of a Supreme Court ruling in the 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA case that greenhouse gases are covered by the Clean Air Act.
                                                        Other measures the EPA said they would take include revisiting Biden-era standards to reduce soot and air particulate matter, dialing back regulations for the oil and gas industry (including required reporting of methane emissions), and allowing the reuse of drilling wastewater, potentially for agriculture and industry.

                                                        Chutkan said that the EPA had asserted substantial fraud, waste, and abuse with the contracts but only provided vague assertions to back up that claim. 
                                                        The grants were terminated as part of Zeldin's campaign to claw back money from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, aimed at curbing pollution.
                                                        The three groups are Climate United, Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities.

                                                        The DOI said the emergency procedures would apply to fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal, uranium, geothermal, critical minerals, biofuels and kinetic hydropower projects and did not list solar energy or wind energy, which Trump has called expensive and ugly.

                                                        The EPA will only maintain current limits on two of these chemicals.

                                                        The Biden rule set limits for five individual PFAS chemicals: PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, PFHxS, and HFPO-DA and gave all public water systems three years to complete monitoring for these chemicals and required them to inform the public of the level of PFAS measured in their drinking water.

                                                        Smith said the TRO is not needed since the NEA had already reversed their policy to withold funding after the ACLU filed their lawsuit.

                                                        Kobick declined to make the injunction nationwide.
                                                        Kobick said Trump's policy of refusing to issue passports to transgender and nonbinary Americans that reflect their gender identities is likely unconstitutional.

                                                        During Trump's first term, in 2017, he tried to move USAID to the State Department, but was blocked by Congress on a bipartisan opposition.
                                                        USAID was established by a law from Congress so Trump cannot unilaterally dismantle it or move it into the State Department.

                                                        Following the order, clinics at camps in Thailand providing shelter for about 100,000 refugees from Myanmar were ordered to shutdown.
                                                        Former head of USAID says 20 million people living with HIV get drugs from USAID to stay alive.
                                                        A week after the order, Marco Rubio issued a waiver for live-saving humanitarian assistance during the 90 day pause, despite the waiver, numerous cases of life-saving aid not being delivered remained, due to a breakdown in communication at USAID from Trump's overhaul.
                                                        Many aid workers erred on the side of caution and closed their aid programs since the US government became unresponsive to them in weather their programs qualified as "life-saving."
                                                        The aid shutdown threw the aid industry into a frenzy, as contractors usually front the costs and then bill the U.S. government, hundreds of aid contractors beginning to lay off employees.    
                                                        Real world effects: aid was stopped to civil war and disaster ridden Myanmar, anti-malaria spraying campaigns were halted in Ghana and Kenya, AIDS treatment in Haiti was paused, hospitals and health clinics in Tailand housing Myanmar refugees in 7 camps closed.
                                                        USAID had also been a funder of free journalism throughout the world, with non-Cuban-government media outlets CubaNet and Diario de Cuba losing their funding (USAID funded $2.3 million in 2024 to independent Cuban media).
                                                        By Feb 2025, the US Disaster Assistance Response Teams, or DARTs (highly trained staff for disaster relief), working in Afghanistan, Gaza, Sudan and Ukraine were forced to shutdown after losing the ability to function due to USAID being destroyed.
                                                        In Mar 2025, Trump cut funding to Gavi ($300 mln annually), a group that provides vaccines for children in poor countries, and would scale back its anti-malaria efforts.
                                                        US universities who study agriculture were hit especially hard by the USAID cuts too, losing billions in funding and being forced to cut researchprograms.

                                                        The FBI later said they were investigating the "targeting" of Elon's staff in relation to the USAID incident, the FBI normally doesn't public discuss investigations until charges are brought.
                                                        In the same X space, Musk said he would cut $1 trillion from the budget in 2025, saying that "professional foreign fraud rings" were stealing large sums of money from the US, without giving evidence or explaining how he reached the $1 trillion figure.

                                                        The lawsuit was filed in Washington DC and alleged that Trump's actions were unconstitutional as Congress is the only entity lawfully permitted to dismantle an agency, the lawsuit seeked to restore USAID's previous funding.
                                                        USAID was previously been established as an independent agency in 1988 by a law passed by Congress.

                                                        On Feb 21, 2025, Nichols lifted the TRO due to the USAID workers not being in danger overseas, clearing the was for Trump to place the 2700 USAID workers on leave.

                                                        The lawsuit was brought by two aid organizations that receive funding from the US government, they argued that Trump's rationale for the freeze, which was to review all aid programs, was not a necessary presursor to achieve his goal.
                                                        On Feb 20, 2025, the same judge, ordered Trump officials to comply with his previous order due to them not following it, stopping short of holding them in contempt of court.

                                                        The appeal said that the delay in unfreezing was due to a new approval process the Trump admin was using to ensure payments aligned with Trump's agenda, which Ali already ruled was an invalid reason for delaying the payments.

                                                        According to government documents, the Trump admin cut 80% of USAID programs as part of the review, 898 programs would remain active ($78 bln) and 5341 would be cut ($76 bln).

                                                        Enrich said in his memo the aid block prevented efforts to contain Ebola in Uganda, resulting in 2 deaths and 10 infections.
                                                        Enrich also said in his memo that since Feb 14, "zero lifesaving health activities" had been approved and the livesaving programs that had waivers could not continue due to DOGE cutting their access to the USAID payment systems.

                                                        Gates focused on organizations such as Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, as well as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and asked Trump to rejoin the WHO.

                                                        The plaintiffs of the lawsuit claimed that Musk seized control of USAID and effectively acted as a US officer, violating the Constitution's requirement that such officers be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, meaning Musk and DOGE had overstepped the authority of the executive branch of government, by effectively gutting an agency established by Congress.
                                                        Trump's defense team argued that Musk's role is strictly as an adviser to Trump and DOGE was not responsible for agency actions since the actions were made by agency officials, but Chuang found that this was not the case and Musk/DOGE had effectively exercised direct control over USAID.
                                                        Chuang ruled that Musk and DOGE "likely violated the United States Constitution in multiple ways, and that these actions harmed not only plaintiffs, but also the public interest."
                                                        On Mar 28, 2025, an appeals court overturned Chuang's ruling, saying that Musk could go forward with further cuts to USAID and that he likely did not violate the constitution.

                                                        However, the league chose not to put the phrase "End Racism" behind one of the end zones, something it has done since 2021, replacing that directive with another one: "Choose Love."
                                                        In the 2024 Super Bowl, Trump ran ads saying "Kamala's for they/them; President Trump is for you."

                                                        Trump had been sued in the Maryland district court by the city of Baltimore and 3 other groups.
                                                        On Mar 14, 2025, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Trump could temporarily implement his ban on DEI while the case was decided, overturning Abelson's TRO.

                                                        On Feb 25, 2025, the American Federation of Teachers and the American Sociological Association sued Trump, seeking to block the DoE memo.
                                                        On Feb 27, 2025, the Dept of Education launched a portal to "End DEI," allowing the public to submit complaints about DEI initiatives in K-12 schools.
                                                        On Mar 10, 2025, US District Judge Myong Joun in Boston issued a TRO on Trump's termination of $600 million in federal grants to train teachers to address teacher shortages in rural and underserved communities that Trump said were included "divisive ideologies," which it said included DEI, "critical race theory" and "anti-racism." 
                                                        On Mar 21, 2025, Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump's bid to have the TRO paused and directed the DOE to restore the $600 mln in grants.
                                                        On April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 to put on hold Joun's TRO, saying administration is "likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money."
                                                        On April 24, 2025, 3 seperate US District judges Judge Landya McCafferty in NH, Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Baltimore, and Judge Dabney Friedrich in DC issued orders blocking Trump from cutting funding to schools that had "DEI programs."

                                                        These grants included funding for energy-efficient affordable homes, weatherized and retrofitted homes in Union Heights (one of first Black communities after emancipation).
                                                        Also cut was a grant to the predominantly Latino community of San Diego's Barrio Logan, who had high rates of asthma due to close proximity to a major highway, which would fund EV busses and upgrades to air quality.
                                                        The EPA also withdrew a Biden-era lawsuit against a synthetic rubber plant's Japanese owners, Denka Performance Elastomer LLC, siding with company lawyers, the Biden admin claimed the plant posed an imminent public health hazard due to emissions of chloroprene being a likely human carcinogen.
                                                        On April 29, 2025, the EPA said they were in the process of cancelling 781 grants, including all environmental justice ones, almost double what was originally reported.

                                                        The memo's step was largely symbolic as federal and state laws still outlaw discrimination and segregation.

                                                        <u>DOJ cuts</u>: 
                                                        On April 23, 2025, the DOJ cut 365 grants worth $811 million for supporting crime victims, including for transgender victims; hotlines used by crime victims; grants to fight human trafficking that have gone to organizations working with immigrants; programs to curb juvenile delinquency and safeguard incarcerated youth; and funding for state-run hate-crime reporting. 
                                                        The cuts were authored by Tarak Makecha, a former Tesla employee, who created the list without consulting program managers at the department's Office of Justice Programs.
                                                        Bondi said the cuts reflected the priorities of Trump.
                                                        DOJ grants typically run for 3 years and grant focuses often change from admin to admin, however, grants are rarely cut outright.
                                                        A day after some Reuters reported on the cuts, seven of them were restored including for a program for pet-friendly domestic violence shelters.
                                                        One terminated grant that wasn't restored was $8.3 million to the National Policing Institute, which funded rural police departments and district attorneys' offices to help pay for automated license plate readers, violent crime investigators, investigations against drug dealers for fentanyl overdoses, and programs to combat child sexual abuse.
                                                        Bondi later tweeted examples of "wasteful grants," including a $2 million to "national listening sessions of individuals with lived experience," DOGE quote tweeted with "Great work."
                                                        That $2 million grant trained prosecutors to investigate child abuse in juvenile detention facilities, youth correctional facilities or group homes; the listening sessions allowed prosecutors to hear directly from youth abuse victims.

                                                        On Jan 29th, the White House offered 2 million federal full-time employees financial incentives to quit in a "deferred resignation program" to further shrink the government.
                                                        The offer went to all employees except those in immigration, national security, or the US Postal Service, and warned that a majority of agencies are likely to be downsized through restructurings and layoffs and that their jobs were not guaranteed.
                                                        By the following week, it was reported that 20,000 federal employees had already taken the offer.
                                                        Following the Reagan airport plane crash, Trump exempted air traffic controllers and federal employees involved in public safety programs from the resignation offer incentives, the exemption came after ATCs already had received early retirement offers.
                                                        The TSA also said their 65,000 workforce was exempt from the offer.
                                                        On Feb 5, 2025, the CIA offered buyouts to its entire workforce, citing that it wanted to bring the agency in line with Trump's EO.
                                                        The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, National Security Agency, National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office were also offered buyouts in addition to the CIA.

                                                        On Feb 6, 2025, a Boston US District judge temporarily blocked Trumps's buyout until 2/10/25 (which was extended until a long term ruling could be made) in ruling on the union's lawsuit, the judge's ruling came hours before the buyout deadline.
                                                        The ruling came even despite there already having been 60,000 federal employees who accepted the offer, out of 2.3 million total federal employees.

                                                        Trump refused to let the AP in because they continued to use the term "Gulf of Mexico" instead of "Gulf of America."
                                                        AP, citing editorial standards, said it would continue to use the gulf's established name.

                                                        On April 8, 2025, McFadden ruled that Trump must allow the AP back into the Oval Office and Air Force One, citing the First Amendment.
                                                        McFadden said that Trump had unlawfully retaliated again the AP for their reporting.

                                                        The three wire services were permanent slot holders due to local news outlets relying on their reporting, due to these local outlets not having a presence in Washington.

                                                        Establishes the President's Working Group on Digital Asset Markets in the National Economic Council. 
                                                        The working group's job is to find all anti-crypto regulations so Trump can rescind them. 
                                                        Trump made venture capitalist and former PayPal exec David Sacks as the leader of the workgroup. 
                                                        The work group will also investigate establishing a national crypto stockpile. 
                                                        The order also protects equal access to banking services, alluding to the claims that crypto companies were cut off from banking services under the direction of US regulators, which the regulators have denied. 
                                                        The order also prohibits Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs). 
                                                        The order followed an announcement by the SEC that they were creating a task force to overhaul crypto policy.

                                                        Trump previously launched the World Liberty Financial Defi crypto project in fall 2024.
                                                        By March 2025, and largely after his Nov 2024 election win, WLF had raised $550 million selling so-called governance tokens that cannot be traded, after only selling $2.7 million at launch in Oct 2024.
                                                        Also as of Mar 2025, WLF was still yet to launch a Defi platform as first stated.
                                                        Overall, the Trump family has a claim on 75% of net revenues from token sales and 60% from World Liberty operations once the core business gets going.
                                                        WLF raised questions of conflicts of intrest, since Trump is in charge of crypto regulation.
                                                        Wallet transactions show that 50% of purchases of $WLFI were for $1 million or more, with most of them purchases being anonymous, meaning they could be oligarcs trying to buy political influence by funnelling money to Trump.
                                                        Trump and his wife Melania also each launched their own memecoins, $TRUMP and $MELANIA, after the election win.

                                                        Sun was a crypto entrepreneur who illegally generated $31 million while running the Tron network and BitTorrent.
                                                        Sun had recently been a prominent buyer of Trump's World Liberty Financial token, buying $75 million of the token, including a $30 mln purchase of $WLFI to jumpstart the project.
                                                        On Feb 28, 2025, a federal judge dismissed an SEC case against Hex founder Richard Heart, saying that the deceptive transactions that Heart directed were conducted on international markets not US ones.

                                                        Trump later said BTC and ETH would also "obviously" be included in the reserve, spirking their prices by 11-13%.

                                                        The largest holder of $TRUMP coin is Justin Sun.
                                                        At the time of the announcement, $TRUMP had a $2.74 billion market cap, with Trump's family company and a second firm together holding 80% of the remaining supply of the meme coins.
                                                        Trump has so far (as of May 2025) made $320.19 million in fees from the meme coin, including at least $1.35 million after the dinner announcement.
                                                        At least two of the largest investors in the $TRUMP contest have made profits in excess of $10 million each, while 15 investors have made more than $1 million.
                                                        Meanwhile, about 600,000 other wallets have lost $3.87 billion so far, with $117 million of losses occurring after Trump announced the dinner on social media

                                                        Trump said that OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle were planning a joint venture called Stargate to build datacenters using the government investment.

                                                        FEMA has become more relevant in recent years due to an increase in natural disasters in the US.
                                                        The EO came after Trump visited disaster torn North Carolina and California, after which he vowed to sign an executive order to overhaul or eliminate the agency.
                                                        Trump had previously said that there were "serious concerns" of political bias at FEMA and that agency funds had been used for programs related to incoming migrants.

                                                        The firings came after Musk posted that DOGE had uncovered millions of dollars spent illegally by FEMA to house migrants in "high end" hotels in New York City.
                                                        However, FEMA only runs the Shelter and Services Program that provides funding to shelter migrants in cities, yet the program is funded by the CBP, not from FEMA's disaster relief funds.
                                                        On 2/10/2025, New York had received two payments related to migrant assistance including one for $58.6 million and the other for $21.9 million, the funds were reimbursments for services delivered between Nov 2023-Oct 2024.
                                                        $19 million of the reimbursments were for hotel costs, with the city never having paid luxury rates for hotels.
                                                        The city paid an average of $152 a night for rooms, mostly outside of Manhattan, luxury hotel rates in Manhattan go for $400-$1000 a night.
                                                        Two days before the firings, a senior FEMA official instructed the agency to freeze funding for grant programs, despite a federal judge's order to stop funding freezes.

                                                        The firing came just as hurricane season was set to start on June 1. 
                                                        Hamilton was chosen by Trump as acting director in Jan 2025, and oversaw steep cuts to the agency and proposed a reduction of assistance to states with less serious disasters.

                                                        On May 11, 2025, FEMA sharply reduced training for state and local emergency managers ahead of the start of the hurricane season on June 1.
                                                        Some 2,000 FEMA employees (a third of full-time staff) have been fired or accepted incentives to quit since Trump took office.
                                                        As part of the FEMA cuts, Trump restricted FEMA travel and speaking engagements, forcing training sessions to move online only, which FEMA said would be ineffective compared to in person trainings.

                                                        Directs the government, through FEMA, to provide a housing plan and debris clearing plan.

                                                        Trump had previously falsely claimed that Gavin Newsom and other officials refused to provide water from northern California to fight the fires.
                                                        This Trump EO directs more water to be used through the Central Valley Project, even if it conflicts with state or local laws, which Newsom said will not make a difference in the LA fires since they get their water from other sources and do not have a shortage.
                                                        Some hydrants went try in LA while fighting the fires but officials said that is because they were not designed to deal with such a massive disaster.

                                                    The revocations reinstated the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion coverage in the US. 
                                                    Trump also issued a memorandum reinstating the Mexico City Policy, which prohibits US federal funding for NGOs that provide or promote abortions.

                                                        The order essentially banned trans people from the military all together, there are over 4000 trans service members. 
                                                        There were exeptions if the service member "demonstrates 36 consecutive months of stability in the service member's sex without clinically significant distress."

                                                        However, the ban had a waiver, saying:

                                                        Which does not apply to any trans service member.

                                                        On Mar 18, 2025, US District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington issued a TRO blocking the US military from enforcing Trumps trans military ban.
                                                        Reyes said the EO likely violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on sex discrimination.
                                                        The case was brought by 20 trans military service members who Trump's defense team had conceded were excellent soldiers and living proof "transgender persons can have the warrior ethos, physical and mental health, selflessness, honor, integrity, and discipline to ensure military excellence."
                                                        On Mar 28, 2025, an appeals court issued a stay (pause) on Reyes TRO, while they ruled on Trump's appeal.
                                                        Hegseth later tweeted "Since 'Judge' Reyes is now a top military planner, she/they can report to Fort Benning at 0600 to instruct our Army Rangers on how to execute High Value Target Raids. After that, Commander Reyes can dispatch to Fort Bragg to train our Green Berets on counterinsurgency warfare."
                                                        Hegseth's tweet came as the Trump admin was mounting pressure on the judiciary for rulings unfavorable to them.

                                                        Settle said the military had operated smoothly for four years under a policy allowing transgender people to serve openly.
                                                        On Mar 31, 2025, Trump's appeal of Settle's ruling was denied by an appeals court.
                                                        On May 6, 2025, the SC ruled 6-3 to lift Settle's PI, allowing Trump to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out.

                                                        Biden implemented the program due to a scarcity of minority officers could create distrust within the US armed forces.
                                                        At the time of the ruling, racial minoritiesmade up 52% of enlisted Navy service members, only 31% of its officers are minorities.

                                                        On April 29, 2025, Hegseth cut a program to increase women in national security.
                                                        In 2017 during Trump's first term, he signed the Women, Peace and Security Act that supported the participation of women in preventing and resolving conflict, countering violent extremism and building post-conflict stability.
                                                        Rubio and Kristi Noem co-sponsored the bill in the Senate and Mike Waltz was a founding member of the WPS congressional caucus at the time.
                                                        Hegseth said "WPS is yet another woke divisive/social justice/Biden initiative that overburdens our commanders and troops — distracting from our core task: WAR-FIGHTING" and said he was proud to have ended the program.
                                                        Hegseth said the DOD will only further execute the minimum WPS required by statute.

                                                        Hegseth later said "I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is our diversity is our strength."

                                                        Trump's admin said that programs delivering aid to Americans would not be affected, including Medicaid which is used by 70 million Americans and totaled $618 bllion in the 2023-24 budget, yet it was confirmed that doctors in all 50 states were unable to secure Medicaid payments, which the White House said was due to a Medicaid portal outage and no payments were actually affected.

                                                        Minutes before the aid pause was set to take place on 1/31/25, a US district judge blocked Trump's spending freeze until 2/3/25 after a lawsuit was brought to the court by the National Council of Nonprofits.
                                                        Trump was also sued by Democratic attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia, who said the freeze violates the constitution.
                                                        Even though Trump rescinded the freeze, a Rhode Island district judge went ahead with a hearing over the matter saying, the states have convinced him that the "inappropriate effects" of the now-rescinded funding freeze directive "are going to continue and that hasn't changed based on comments by the president's press secretary." 
                                                        On 2/4/2025, a Washington US District judge, Loren AliKhan, extended the pause on Trump's plan to freeze federal loans, grants, and other assistance, saying it may have "run roughshod" over Congress's constitutional authority over government spending. 
                                                        On Feb 7, 2025, AGs from the 22 Dem states in the lawsuit asked the federal judge in their case to enforce the order blocking Trump from freezing federal funding.
                                                        The Dem AGs said that the still-frozen funds include $4.5 billion for a home electrification rebate program, at least some of $7 billion for rooftop solar panels, $5 billion supporting state, local and Native American tribal governments' greenhouse gas reduction measures and $117.5 million for air quality monitoring.

                                                        One day after the memo, on Jan 29th, the Trump admin abandoned the federal funding freeze and rescinded their original memo.
                                                        Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt also later said that depsite the memo being rescinded, the EOs on federal funding "remain in full force and effect." 
                                                        Despite the federal judge blocking of Trump's EO, hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding remained frozen. 
                                                        The constitution gives Congress power over federal spending and the president must give Congress advanced notice of impoundments before taking action.

                                                        The $20 million is just part of nearly $19.5 bln for farm programs over 10 years by the Inflation Reduction Act, which is yet to be unfrozen.

                                                        McConnell said Trump had impeded on Congress' power and overstepped is own power in the ruling.

                                                        The lawsuit came due to hospitals beginning to cancel gender-affirming care appointments directly after Trump's order.

                                                        In a fact sheet on the order Trump said "To all the resident aliens who joined in the pro-jihadist protests, we put you on notice: come 2025, we will find you, and we will deport you."

                                                        The same day, the Trump admin began reviewing Columbia University's federal contracts and grants with $51.4 million over allegations of antisemitism during the Gaza protests.
                                                        On Mar 5, 2025, the DOJ also opened a civil rights investigation into the University of California to determine if they allowed anti-Semitism during the Gaza protests of 2023.

                                                        On Mar 7, 2025, the Trump admin cut $400 million in grants and contracts (of the $5 billion they have) to Columbia University because of what it described as antisemitic harassment.
                                                        Due to the cuts, Columbia was forced to cancel projects including the development of an AI-based tool that helps nurses detect the deterioration of a patient's health in hospital and research on uterine fibroids, non-cancerous tumors that affect women's fertility.
                                                        On Mar 13, 2025, Colombia responded to the funding cut by punishing students with multi-year suspensions, temporary degree revocations, and expulsions related to the occupation of Hamilton Hall during the Gaza protests.
                                                        On Mar 14, 2025, federal agents raided two Columbia student residencies after the Trump admin ordered them to formally define antisemitism, ban the wearing of masks "intended to conceal identity or intimidate" and place the university's Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies Department under "academic receivership" for at least five years.
                                                        On Mar 21, 2025, Columbia agreed to reform its disciplinary process, hire security officers with arrest powers and appoint a new official with a broad remit to review departments that offer courses on the Middle East in order to coply with Trump admin demands to restore funding.
                                                        Following the concessions from Columbia, their interim president, Katrina Armstrong, resigned and Trump still refused to return their funding.
                                                        On May 6, 2025, fired 180 researchers, many in healthcare and scientific research, due to the Trump funding cuts.
                                                        On May 7, 2025, pro-Palestinian protestors occupied Columbia's main library, resulting in 40-50 arrests taking place due to alleged trespassing when Columbia officials requested NYPD assistance, 85 of them were students and were suspended and banned from taking their final exams.

                                                        <u>Mahmoud Khalil</u>: 
                                                        On Mar 9, 2025, Columbia grad student and Palestinian refugee with permanent US green card residency, Mahmoud Khalil, was arrested by US ICE agents and taken to a deportation jail due to his participation in the 2023 Gaza protests.
                                                        Rubio then tweeeted, "We will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported."
                                                        Under a provision of the 1952 U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, any immigrants may be deported if the secretary of state deems their presence in the country potentially adverse to American foreign policy.
                                                        The DHS said Khalil was arrested because he "led activities aligned to Hamas," which is not illegal under US law, the US only prohibits providing "material support or resources" to terrorist groups.
                                                        The next day, US District Court Judge Jesse Furman put a hold (later extended) on Khalil's deportation "unless and until the Court orders otherwise."
                                                        On Mar 13, 2025, the group Jewish Voice for Peace led a protest against Khalil's arrest at Trump Tower
                                                        Also on Mar 13, Khalil asked a federal court to block Columbia from sharing student disciplinary records from campus protests with a Republican-led House committee.
                                                        On Mar 23, 2025, the Trump admin said that they wanted to deport Khalil because he withheld that he was part of UNRWA and that he worked for the Syria office in the British embassy in Beirut on his visa application.
                                                        On April 11, 2025, immigration Judge Jamee Comans (appointed by the DOJ) of the LaSalle Immigration Court in Louisiana ruled that Khalil could be deported, saying she didn;t have the authority to overrule Rubio.
                                                        On May 7, 2025, US District Court Judge Michael Farbiarz in Newark, New Jersey ordered Trump to detail the legal precedent for Rubio's deportation determination for Khalil, giving them 2 days to repond.

                                                        Alawieh was in the US from Lebanon with an H-1B visa.
                                                        US District Judge Leo Sorokin then issued an order barring Alawieh's removal from the US.
                                                        However, despite the order, CBP went ahead and deported Alawieh back to Lebanon anyways, while still not giving a reason why.
                                                        The CBP later said they found deleted photos of Nasrallah and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on her phone and Alawieh told them that she had attended Nasrallah's funeral in Lebanon the previous month, saying she did so for religious, not political, reasons.

                                                        The DHS accused Suri of ties to Hamas and spreading Hamas propaganda and antisemitism on social media. 
                                                        Suri is living in the US on a student visa and is married to an American citizen, who is a woman from Gaza.

                                                        In response, US District Judge Indira Talwani ordered ICE not to deport her without providing advanced notice. 
                                                        Ozturk was in the US on an F-1 visa (student visa while studying) and had previously criticised Tufts for their respose to the Israel divest movement on campus and called for the university to "acknowledge the Palestinian genocide."
                                                        In reponse to Ozturks arrest, Rubio said that they had already revoked the visas of over 300 pro-Pal protestors.
                                                        On Mar 29, 2025, US District Judge Denise Casper in Boston ordered Ozturk not be deported temporarily while her case is resolved.
                                                        On April 18, 2025, US District Judge William Sessions ordered Ozturk be returned to Vermont from Louisiana while her case played out, saying that Ozturk had presented evidence that Trump went after her for her pr-Pal views and violated her free speech rights.
                                                        On May 7, 2025, an appeals court rejected his appeal, and ordered him to obey Sessions' order to return Ozturk to Vermont.
                                                        On May 9, 2025, Ozturk was released after 6 weeks of detention following a bail order from Sessions, saying her detention chilled the speech of millions of non-citizens.

                                                        Tariffs all Canada goods coming to US at an additional 25% except energy imports, which only get a 10% tariff increase.
                                                        Allows Trump to increase tariffs further if Canada retaliates.
                                                        Directs Homeland security to imform Trump when Canada has done enough at the northern border to have the tariffs lifted, or if the tariffs should be increased due to Canadian inaction.
                                                        The tariffs, came after Trump promised to impose them on the campaign trail, even though many of his Republican allies down played his threats saying Trump was just using tariffs as a negotiating tactic.
                                                        Despite Trump using fentanyl as the reason for the tariffs, the US only seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border in 2024, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexico border. 
                                                        On immigration, the US saw only 23,721 encounters at the Canadian border from Oct 2023-Sept 2024, compared to 1.53 million encounters at the Mexico border.
                                                        After the order, Canada immediately ordered retalitory tariffs against $155 billion of US goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances.
                                                        A later fact sheet from the White House said the tariffs would stay in place "until the crisis alleviated," but gave no details. 
                                                        The National Foreign Trade Council President said Trump's move threatened to raise the costs of "everything from avocados to automobiles."
                                                        An hour and a half after the order, the American national anthem was booed in the nation's capital Ottawa ahead of the opening face-off at the Ottawa Senators and Minnesota Wild National Hockey League game. The Senators won 6-0.
                                                        Analysts expect oil/gas prices to rise for consumers in the US due to the tariffs, with Canada importing some 4 million barrels per day of Canadian oil.

                                                        In March 2025, Trump repeadedly claimed that Canada had a 250%-270% tariff on US dairy products.
                                                        However, Trump failed to mention that these tariffs would only come into effect if certain quotas were met.
                                                        In 2024, the tariffs rarely came into effect, with US dairy only having a tariff quota rate of 26.72%.
                                                        The quotas and tariffs were negotiated under the USMCA, which Trump negotiated himself.

                                                    Following the EOs, Trump said the tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China may cause "short term" pain for Americans.
                                                    Almost all fentanyl enters the US through official land crossings between the US-Mexico in California and Arizona.
                                                    The chemicals used to make fentanyl are made by Chinese companied for legal painkillers but are sometimes sold to the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels, who make the synthetic opioid in labs and then smuggle it into the US.
                                                    During 2024, the US seized 21,100 pounds of fentanyl at the Mexican border, the US also reported 1.53 million migrant encounters at the border beteen Oct 2023-Sept 2024.

                                                        The EO had originally stated that the "de minimis" duty exemption for packages valued at under $800 would be closed, which was previously used by discount retailers like Temu, Shein,  
                                                        International shippers said there might still be disruptions as they work out how tariffs on small packages would be collected, which the CBP still has yet to work out.
                                                        Trump had to reverse this section of the order after millions of packages piled up due to confusion.

                                                        The pause came after Mexico agreed to reinforce the US border with 10,000 National Guard members to stem the flow of immigrants and drugs.
                                                        At the time of the pause, there were already 10,000 Mexican troops already at the border
                                                        Previously, in 2021, Biden struck an agreement with Mexico, Honduras, and Guatemala, where Mexico agreed to deploy 10,000 troops to the Mexico border.
                                                        Mexico also previously sent 15,000 troops to the border in 2019 under the threat of tariffs from Trump.
                                                        However, according to the US sentencin commission, in 2023, 86.4% of individuals sentenced for fentanyl trafficking were US citizens coming into the US through legal routes, meaning the Mexico troop increase will likely do little to stop the flow of fentanyl.

                                                        Those handed over include Rafael Caro Quintero (responsible for 1985 killing of DEA agent) and Antonio Oseguera Cervantes (brother of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel).

                                                    Over 90 countries already have sovereign wealth funds, which are used to invest government dollars in direct investments.
                                                    Alaska, Texas, and New Mexico already have their own sovereign wealth funds too for funding priorities like education and tax relief.
                                                    Unclear how the fund will be funded, typically such funds rely on a country's budget surplus for funding but the US normally runs a deficit.
                                                    The fund will also likely require approval from Congress.
                                                    Bloomberg previously reported that Trump was considering turning the US International Development Finance Corp (DFC) into a sovereign wealth fund, the DFC is currently used to finance private projects in the developing world.
                                                    After signing the EO, Trump suggested the wealth fund could buy TikTok.

                                                        During Trump's presidential campaign, multiple Iranian assassination plots on Trump were twarted by the DOJ.

                                                        Trump's order was largely symbolic as it was signed at the same time that Netanyahu was visiting from Israel.
                                                        Trump commented on the UN organizations saying "It's not being well run, to be honest and they're not doing the job."
                                                        The UN reponded by saying UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres "has worked tirelessly to implement many reforms ... to increase efficiency and innovation."
                                                        Before the order the US was the UNRWA's largest donor, providing $300 million-$400 million a year, UNRWA is responsible for providing aid and education to millions of Pals in Gaza, the WB, Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan.
                                                        Biden had previously suspended funding to UNRWA after Israel accused a dozen of its staff of being Hamas members, Congress then formally suspended contributions untim March 2025.
                                                        UNRWA later fired 9 of their staff after finding they were involved in Oct 7, a Hamas commander in Lebanon who was killed by Israel in Sept 2024 was also found to be an UNRWA member.
                                                        At the time of the order the US was also not a member of the UNHRC, after their 2022-24 term under Biden ended.
                                                        The order also called for a review of UNESCO, which the US has withheld funding for since 2011 due to the body admitting the Palestinians as a full member.

                                                        <u>NCAA response</u>: 
                                                        The order's purpose was to exclude transgender girls and women from female sports.
                                                        Trump signed the order at a signing ceremony with about 100 women and girls aligned behind him, many of the youngest ones wearing uniforms and sports jerseys.
                                                        In the NCAA, there are less than 10 transgender athletes among the 530,000 competing at 1,100 member schools.
                                                        Before the EO, the NCAA required trans women athleted to meet testosterone limits on a sport-by-sport basis.
                                                        However, the NCAA said they would conform to the EO and welcomed it for providing a clear national standard in the face of "a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions." 
                                                        Federal courts have usually ruled in favor of letting trans athletes compete, including by blocking an Idaho, West Virginia, Arizona, and New Hampshire trans sports ban, bt a Kentucky District Court ruled against Biden's interpretation of Title IX protecting trans people from discrimination.

                                                        The move followed an argument between Trump and Governor Janet Mills over the state's refusal to ban transgender athletes from girls' sports.
                                                        The funding supported 4-H, a social and educational youth program; training to help farmers manage pests; and research to ensure the sustainability of Maine's lobster industry, among other programs.
                                                        On April 11, 2025, Trump cut $250 million in funding to Maine public schools over their stance on trans athletes in women's sports.
                                                        The same day, US District Judge John Woodcock Jr issued a TRO blocking the USDA from cutting off grant money Maine uses for nutrition programs (kids' school lunches).
                                                        On May 2, 2025, the USDA settled with Maine to begin funding kid's school lunches again, however the Education Dept will still withold their funding.

                                                        The order came a week after Senate Democrats blocked a Republican-led effort to pass legislation setting up a sanctions regime targeting the ICC.
                                                        Neither the US nor Israel is a member of the ICC, which accused Israeli PM Netanyahu of war crimes and issued an arrest warrant for him.
                                                        Biden had called the warrants an abomination, and Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz, has accused the court of having an antisemitic bias.
                                                        Trump's EO came as Netanyahu was still visiting Washington.
                                                        A 2002 US law already authorizes the Pentagon to liberate any American or U.S. ally held by the court.
                                                        In 2022, Trump previously sanctioned the ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda for investigating war crimes by all sides of the US-Afghanistan conflict, Biden lifted the sanctions when he took office.
                                                        A day after the EO was signed, a group of 79 countries signed a joint statement saying "We reaffirm our continued and unwavering support for the independence, impartiality and integrity of the ICC."
                                                        Among those that signed the statement were France, Germany and Britain. Those that didn't sign the statement include Australia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Italy.

                                                        South Africa responded to the EO saying it "lacks factual accuracy and fails to recognize South Africa's profound and painful history of colonialism and apartheid."
                                                        South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the law aimed at making it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest, defending the policy by the government had not confiscated any land.
                                                        He said the policy was aimed at evening out racial disparities in land ownership in the Black-majority nation.
                                                        Afrikaners are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers.
                                                        South Africa's British imperial masters gave most farmland to whites and in 1950, the Afrikaner National Party passed a law taking 85% of territory for themselves, kicking 3.5 million Black people off their ancestral homelands.
                                                        The African National Congress has been in power since 1994, in which some land restitution has happened, but white landowners still possess three-quarters of South Africa's freehold farmland, compared to 4% owned by black people.

                                                        Trump's DOJ also dropped charges on Republican congressman, Jeff Fortenberry, who had been awaiting trial on charges accusing him of lying to the FBI, as well as the 2 Trump aids charges along Trump in his documents case.
                                                        The moves showed Trump's willingness to break from having an apolitical justice system in favor of aligning the DOJ with Trump's political agenda.

                                                        The increases are extensions of Trump's 2018 Section 232 tariffs to protect domestic steel and aluminum makers on national security grounds.
                                                        Also imposes a new North American standard requiring steel imports to be "melted and poured" and aluminum to be "smelted and cast" within the region.
                                                        US aluminum smelters produced just 670,000 metric tons of the metal in 2024, down from 3.7 million in 2000

                                                        The plan requires that any agency can only hire one employee for every 4 employees that depart, and hiring must go through DOGE first.
                                                        The plan shouldn't apply to functions related to public safety, immigration enforcement, or law enforcement.

                                                        Musk originally stated that DOGE was only a good-faith effort to save taxpayer's dollars and eliminate fraud, saying he would save $2 trillion in federal funds (later dropped to $1 trillion, then dropped again to $150 billion ).
                                                        However, after DOGE's creation, they began targeting organizations that only account for a tiny fraction of the US budget ($7 trillion in 2025), making it appear that Musk was targeting agancies based on political ideology rather than what he originally said.
                                                        Of the 15 agencies that Musk targeted within the first month of the Trump presidency, 9 of them were singled out for downsizing in Project 2025 due to the agencies as pushing liberal agendas.
                                                        These agencies included the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), charged with providing weather forecasting and climate data; the Department of Education, whose mandate includes prohibiting discrimination in schools and colleges; the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which protects consumers from exploitative lenders; the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the government's main foreign aid organization; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which responds to natural disasters.
                                                        USAID spent $42 billion in 2024 (0.6% of the budget) and the CFPB spent $777 million in 2024 (is funded by the Federal Reserve).
                                                        Musk also originally stated that DOGE was "maximally transparent," yet DOGE provided almost no information on who it employed, where they work, and what actions they are taking at government agencies.

                                                        After some DOGE actions and Trump EO's were held up in court, Musk took to X to critisice the judiciary.
                                                        Musk tweeted "We should at least ATTEMPT to fire this junky jurist. The notion of having a judge job for life, no matter how bad the judgments, is ridiculous!" and "Democracy in America is being destroyed by judicial coup." 
                                                        Musk also reposted photos of at least three judges who ruled against Trump policies and took aim at the law firms helping advocacy groups challenge Trump policies saying "Which law firms are pushing these anti-democratic cases to impede the will of the people?".
                                                        After a judge blocked DOGE from accessing Treasury data JD Vance tweeted "judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power."
                                                        Trump also critisized the rulings, Truthing "He who saves his Country does not violate any Law," a quote made by France's Napoleon Bonaparte right before he declared himself emperor.
                                                        Musk's actions led the US Marshals to warn of increased threat levels for federal judges and Chief Justice Roberts to warn against calls for violence against judges and "dangerous" suggestions by elected officials to disregard court rulings they disagree with.
                                                        On May 1, 2025, Supreme Court Judge Jackson sais Trump/Musk's attacks on judges were "not random" and seemed "designed to intimidate the judiciary."

                                                        The GSA also layed off 90 tech workers in the 18F group that built the free tax filing website for the government, Musk referred to the team as a "far-left government-wide computer office."

                                                        On Feb 14, the EPA also fired 388 probationary employees.

                                                        On Feb 17, 2025, 1000 probationary workers at the FDA were laid off, including the staff working on reviewing safety trials for Musk's Neuralink. 
                                                        Also in Feb 17, 2025, the FAA fired 400 probationary workers despite increased scrutiny due to recent plane crashes.
                                                        Many workers at the FDA, CFPB, and FDIC, were fired despite their jobs being funded by fees from banks and companies, not taxpayers, which wouldn't reduce government spending.
                                                        The mass firings were also done hastily, with many nuclear workers, bird flu scientists, veterans affairs employees, and hydroelectric dam workers being rehired after being fired.
                                                        On Feb 22, 2025, the FDA rehired 300 workers they had fired, including some that worked on regulating Musk's Neuralink. 
                                                        Despite the chaos that the firings caused, a US District judge ruled on Feb 20, 2025 that the firings were not illegal and could continue, saying unions suing Trump didn't have standing.

                                                        However, On Feb 24, 2025, a differens district judge, Deborah Boardman, issued a TRO on DOGE and Musk from accessing Dept of Education and OPM data, saying the Privacy Act of 1974 was likely violated.
                                                        But on April 7, 2025, an appeals court paused Boardman's TRO while the appeal case plays out.

                                                        On the same day, NASA went ahead with firing 1000 new hires, the IRS identified 6700 for dismissal (hired under Biden to target wealthy tax fraud), the FTC fired newhires, and the FDIC fired probationary workers.  
                                                        On Feb 21, 2025, the Pentagon said they would fire 5400 employees, down from their original target of 50,000.
                                                        On Feb 24, 2024 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) laid off 4% of its staff.
                                                        On Feb 27, 2025, NOAA fired 800 employees but later reinstated them in April 2025.
                                                        On Feb 28, 2025, the Social Security Administration said they were cutting 7000 of their staff (12% cut).
                                                        On March 6, 2025, the CIA fired an unspecified number of probationary workers.
                                                        By the start of March, 2025, Trump and Musk had fired over 20,000 workers as part of their campaign.
                                                        Many of the fired employees who had Top Secret security clearances were also not debriefed, having m=national security implications due to the heightened risk of foreign adversaries attempting to steal US data and technology and recruit Americans as spies.

                                                        In Feb 2025, both Trump and Musk claimed that tens of millions of dead people were claiming Social Security, including people who were 100, 200, and even 300 years old.
                                                        However, the acting Social Security commissioner, Lee Dudek, said the records Musk and Trump were referring to were just individuals who didn't have a death date and that they were not necessary receiving benefits.
                                                        As of 2015, the agency automatically stopped payments to anyone over 115 years old.
                                                        The Social Security IG said that the agency has not established a new system to properly annotate death info in its database (due to it costing $9 mln), which included 18.9 mln people in its database born before 1920.
                                                        In 2024, the Social Security IG said that from 2015-22 they paid out $8.6 tln, with $71.8 bln being improper payments (mostly erroneous overpayments to living people).
                                                        Also, in Jan 2025, the Treasury recovered $31 million in improper payments from dead people, including from Social Security.  
                                                        According to research analysts, the most improper payments occur in Medicaid, which Musk hasn't looked at yet, and Social Security is very low on the list.
                                                        On April 25, 2025, the Trump admin moved to cut the Social Security Advisory Board, a bipartisan board that advises the president and Congress on Social Security policy, in a further effort to restrict independent voices.

                                                        The unions include: American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE); the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; AFGE Local 1216 in San Francisco, and the United Nurses Associations of California/Union of Health Care Professionals.
                                                        On Feb 27, 2025, District Judge William Alsup blocked the Trump admin from firing probationary workers, saying the OPM lacked the power to order federal agencies to fire any workers (after the OPM sent a memo ordering agencies to do just that).

                                                        On Feb 22, 2025, DOGE sent an email to all federal workers telling them to respond with the work they did in the past week by 11:59PM Mon 2/24.
                                                        Musk later tweeted that any employees who didn't respond would be fired.
                                                        The DoD, Dept of State, DHS, DoE, HHS, Dept of Commerce, IRS, FDIC, NIH, and OPM all told their wrokers not to respond to the email.
                                                        FBI director Kash Patel told all FBI workers to ignore the email was well.
                                                        The Pentagon later ordered the DoD to comply with the Musk email and respond with 5 accomplishments, after initially saying not to respond.
                                                        According to WH sources, Trump and Susie Wiles had not signed off on the email, when asked by the media about the emails, Trump said "it's somewhat voluntary. But it's also, if you don't answer, I guess you get fired," suggesting he was not in the loop on the emails. 
                                                        On late Monday Musk tweeted "Subject to the discretion of the president, they will be given another chance. Failure to respond a second time will result in termination."
                                                        At Trump's first cabinet meeting on Feb 26, 2025, Musk said he suspected the government was employing dead people and that is why he sent out the emails.

                                                        However, for 941 of the contracts, the government had already obligated money for the program, meaning the money was already spent and there would be no savings.
                                                        Some of the contracts were intended to modernize and improve government systems, seemingly going against DOGE's mission.
                                                        This included a contract with Deloitte to restructure the CDC after COVID.
                                                        Within the first week of the "wall of receipts" going live, over 1,000 of the entries were taken down due to them being riddled with errors and corrections.

                                                        Musk said "The President has made it clear that this is mandatory for the executive branch" and "Anyone working on classified or other sensitive matters is still required to respond if they receive the email, but can simply reply that their work is sensitive."
                                                        The second round of emails says that the will be recurring weekly but didn't include any threat of retaliation for noncompliance.
                                                        Hegseth told the DoD and Ed Martin told the DOJ to respond to the email, while the Dept of State told their workers to hold off.

                                                        On March 13, 2025, 2 US District Judges, James Bredar in Baltimore and William Alsup in San Francisco, issued TROs ordering Trump to reinstate thousands of probationary workers accross 19 agencies, including CFPB and USAID, for illegally firing them.
                                                        Judge Bredar said "The sheer number of employees that were terminated in a matter of days belies any argument that these terminations were due to the employees' individual unsatisfactory performance or conduct."
                                                        Judge Alsup said "It is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well that's a lie."
                                                        Earlier in March, the Merit Systems Protection Board ordered 6000 probationary employees at the USDA be reinstated.
                                                        The Trump admin later admitted to firing 24,500 probationary (previously they didn't publicly), and said they began reinstating them on March 18, 2025, but they just placed them on administrative leave instead.
                                                        On Mar 21, 2025, Trump's appeal to have Bredar's TRO paused was rejected.
                                                        On Mar 26, 2025, Trump's appeal to have Alsup's order paused was rejected.
                                                        On April 1, 2025, Bredar narrowed his earlier TRO to only apply to the 19 Dem states who were suing Trump in the case, not the entire US as in his earlier ruling.
                                                        On April 8, 2025, the Supreme Court paused Alsup's order, saying that some of the plantiffs in the case didn't have standing.
                                                        On April 9, 2025, Bredar's TRO was also paused by an appeals court, who said they likely didn't have standing.

                                                        Upon returning, the employees found cockaroach infestations and no desks or chairs to work at, with many fighting for office space.

                                                        On April 1, 2025, the firings began, with Peter Stein, the director of the Office of New Drugs in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research division resigning when faced with being fired, and Brian King, the head of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products division, being fired, along with thousands of other health employees being turned away at the door when trying to go to work.
                                                        Also included in the layoffs were FDA administrative employees from the bird flu response team (tests pet food for bird flu).
                                                        In late April the USDA also fired 3 employees from the bird flu response team who refused a DOGE buyout offer.

                                                        Orders the NIH to identify the root cause of why so many American's are getting sick.
                                                        Orders agencies to work with farmers to ensure US food is the healthiest, most abundant, and most affordable in the world.
                                                        Orders agencies to allow expanded treatment options (like Ivermectin) and make these options covered by health insurance.
                                                        Establishes the Make America Healthy Again Commission chaired by the Secretary of the HHS (RFK Jr).
                                                        The mission of the commission is to advise Trump on addressing "the childhood chronic disease crisis."
                                                        The commission must submit a "Make our Children Healthy Again Assessment" to Trump within 100 days that assesses childhood chronic disease in America. 
                                                        The assessment includes looking at medications, certain food ingredients, SSRI usage, physical activity, mental health.
                                                        Orders the commission to submit within 180 days to Trump a "Make our Children Healthy Again Strategy" to implement the findings from the assessment.

                                                        After the EO, Kennedy vowed to open up its data, conduct new scientific studies on vaccines and tackle gaps in rural healthcare with artificial intelligence and telemedicine. 
                                                        He said he also planned to go after food additives, which are regulated by the FDA.
                                                        Kennedy also said he plans to review of the safety of abortion drug mifepristone after Trump ordered him to, which was a policy proposal from Project 2025.
                                                        However, Kennedy and his ambissions from the MAHA commission are in direct opposition to Trump's proposed downsizing of the federal workforce.

                                                        One issue that RFK Jr called for the end to in the past is fluoride in water, which occurs naturally in some water and can prevent tooth decay.
                                                        After fluoride began to be added to the US water supply in the 1940s, the US saw a massive decline in tooth decay (60% decrease among school children).
                                                        Water fluoridation is typically done at the state and local level and is not mandated federally.
                                                        However, the NIH conducted a meta-analysis that showed IQ was lower in children with high fluoride exposure.
                                                        Cochrane also did a meta-analysis and found that including fluoride in water only has modest benefits in reducing tooth decay.

                                                        The ACIP meeting was later rescheduled for April 2025.

                                                        On Feb 10, 2025, a US District judge, Angel Kelley, issued a TRO on the Trump admin from freezing funding to the NIH for labs and clinical trials.
                                                        The order was later extended while the case was decided.
                                                        The NIH had previously sharply reduced the rate at which it reimbursed research institutions for "indirect costs" (like lab space, faculty, equipment and infrastructure), which Trump capped at 15% from 27%-28%.
                                                        On Mar 6, 2025, Kelley made a final ruling, issuing a nationwide block on the cutting of the NIH reaearch funding, saying they were unlawful.

                                                        <u>Measles ourbreak</u>: 
                                                        In late Feb 2025, there was a a measles outbreak of 500 people in Texas and New Mexico, with the first child dying of measles since 2015 also (second child later died in April 2025 in same outbreak).
                                                        Kennedy said the child who died in April died from "a bacteriological infection" but not measles, a common anti-vax tactic, despite Texas health officials saying measles was the cause.
                                                        Kennedy responded by saying outbreaks were not "unusual" and that there were 16 in 2024, rather than emphasizing the need for vaccination, Kennedy later went on to endorse the vaccine as the best way to prevent measles while still advocating for alt-treatments as well.
                                                        The alternative treatments included Vitamin A (only works for malnurished kids), steroid budesonide (risky due to immune system suppression), and the antibiotic clarithromycin (antibiotics cannot treat viral infections).
                                                        Public health experts called for the Trump admin to encourage vaccines at the national level due to almost all (97%) the children being admitted to the hospital during the outbreak being unvaccinated, with some using Vitamin A instead due to advice from Kennedy's Children's Health Defense.
                                                        Kennedy also said patients were only being held at the hospital to quarantine, but Texas hospital officials said they were not and the patients had serious respiratory issues.
                                                        Despite the outbreak, on Mar 11, 2025, RFK Jr went on Hannity and said the MMR vaccine causes "deaths every year," despite there being no recorded deaths from the MMR vaccine in healthy, non-immunocompromised people.
                                                        Later in April 2025, RFK Jr said that measles is always going to be around since the MMR vaccine wanes quickly, despite the MMR vaccine having 97% lifetime effectiveness after 2 doses.
                                                        In 1963 before the vaccine there were 3-4 million measles cases a year, not it is usually fewer than 200 in a normal year.
                                                        High vaccination rates are important because when 95% of people are vaccinated then the community has herd immunity, which protects people who are too young or who cannot get the vaccine due to health issues.
                                                        On May 1, 2025, Kennedy also said that the MMR vaccines contain aborted fetal debris (which they do not, rubella vaccine was first produced from a fetal cell line in the 1960s) and that the mumps vaccine didn't work (despite having 86% effectivness).

                                                        The grants included funding to track, prevent and control infectious diseases, including measles and bird flu, as well as track mental health services and fund addiction treatment. 
                                                        On April 3, 2025, US District Judge Mary S. McElroy in Rhode Island issued a TRO blocking Trump from cutting the HHS funding.
                                                        On May 6, 2025, US District Judge Edgardo Ramos issued a preliminary injunction blocking Trump from canceling more than $1.1 billion in unspent aid meant to help U.S. elementary and high schools address the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

                                                        <u>Peter Marks fired</u>: 
                                                        On Mar 29, 2025, the FDA's top vaccine official, Peter Marks, was forced to resign by HHS officials.
                                                        In his resignation letter, Marks wrote, "It has become clear that truth and transparency are not desired by the Secretary, but rather he wishes subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies."
                                                        Marks' resignation came after Kennedy requested that Marks turn over data on cases of brain swelling and deaths caused by the measles vaccine, which Marks said is data that doesn't exist.
                                                        Marks was temporarily replaced by FDA insider Scott Steele, a WH adviser on science and technology during Bush 43.
                                                        On May 6, 2025, Marks was succeeded by Vinay Prasad, a noted COVID vaccine mandates, and FDA leadership critic.

                                                        As part of DOGE cuts, the FDA fired 3500 staff.
                                                        This included 15 senior FDA negotiators in talks with the pharmaceutical industry over renewing the user fee programs that fund the FDA's drug review system (70% of funding comes from these industry fees).
                                                        However, on May 2, 2025, 10 of the negotiating staff were asked to return from being fired.
                                                        The cuts also included the FDA quality control program for its food testing laboratories, affecting lab testing for the parasite Cyclospora in spinach or the pesticide glyphosate in barley.
                                                        The cuts also included the Interlaboratory Comparison Exercise for detecting Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza program, which was an effort to improve its bird flu testing of milk, cheese and pet food.
                                                        On April 17, 2025, the FDA announced they would limit employees from pharma companies regulated by the FDA from serving on the FDA's advisory committees to reduce conflicts of intrest.
                                                        On April 21, 2025, the FDA suspended its proficiency testing program for Grade "A" (or fluid milk, meets the highest sanitary standards) raw milk and finished products due to staffing shortages.

                                                        <u>Autism</u>: 
                                                        RFK Jr has claimed that autism is an "epidemic" and that we know that it is caused by "environmental exposure."
                                                        The autism rate in 8 year olds in the US was 3.2% (1 in 31) in 2022, up from 0.66% in 2000.
                                                        Research suggests 80% of autism risk is genetic, including Fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, Phelan-McDermid syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome.
                                                        In the late 1990s, British researcher Andrew Wakefield published a since-debunked study linking measles vaccines to higher autism rates, RFK Jr has since promoted the theory that vaccines cause autism.
                                                        No rigorous studies have found links between autism and vaccines or their components such as thimerosal or formaldehyde.
                                                        Also, vaccination rates have declined as autism rates have climbed.
                                                        Researchers largely attribute the rise in autism diagnoses to more widespread screening and the inclusion of a wider range of behaviors to describe the condition. 
                                                        Historically, the definition of autism included moderate to severe intellectual disabilities but today the most severe forms account for only about 25% of cases.

                                                        On April 22, 2025, the FDA announced they would begin removing food dyes from the US food supply by revoking authorization for 2 dyes and working with the private sector to remove 6 others.
                                                        They cited concerns about a possible link between consumption of the dyes and health conditions like ADHD, obesity and diabetes.
                                                        The FDA said they also planned to authorize 4 new natural color additives (in May 2025 they approved 3 natural dyes).
                                                        At the April 2025 cabinet meeting, RFK Jr said food dyes "affects academic performance, violence in the schools, and mental health, as well as physical health."
                                                        Research shows synthetic food colors common in the U.S. are linked to neurobehavioral problems in children and may cause or exacerbate symptoms, particularly hyperactivity.
                                                        However, there is no clear evidence of a direct relationship between food dyes and academic performance, violence or other mental and physical conditions.

                                                        In April 2025, the FDA delayed the approval of the Novavax COVID vaccine, saying it would only get approved if the company agrees to provide additional clinical data on effectiveness after the approval.
                                                        Novavax is not an mRNA vaccine and is the only alternative to mRNA vaccines for many people.
                                                        RFK Jr said that the Novavax shot targets only one antigen or part of the virus to produce an immune response and "single-antigen vaccines have never worked for respiratory illnesses."
                                                        This is not true, as all of the first-generation COVID-19 vaccines were single-antigen vaccines.

                                                        The Consumer Protection Branch is an unusual office because its work involves a hybrid of criminal prosecutions and civil enforcement.
                                                        The CPB previously brought high profile cases against Walgreens, who agreed to pay $350 million for illegally filling unlawful opioid prescriptions and filing false claims to the government, and against the Peanut Corporation for crimes that led to a 2009 outbreak involving more than 700 cases of salmonella poisoning.

                                                        The workshop was expected to discuss best practices for the use of personal protective equipment for people at heightened risk of bird flu, like farmworkers and veterinarians.

                                                        In connection with this, Trump asked the head of the criminal division at the AG's office, Denise Cheung, to open a criminal grand-jury investigation for wire fraud and conspiracy into one of these contracts awarded under Biden.
                                                        Cheung refused to open the investigation, citing lack of evidence, upon which she was ordered instead to pursue an asset seizure to prevent the recipient of the contract from getting funding.
                                                        Cheung consulted with the FBI before deciding to recommend a "30-day administrative freeze on certain assets," which the Trump admin told her was no adequate and again demanded a full freeze and asked her to resign.
                                                        On Feb 18, 2025, Cheung announced her resignation after 24 years with the DOJ.

                                                        All US states currectly have laws mandating children in schools be vaccinated from measles, mumps, polio, tetanus, whooping cough and chickenpox, with excemptions if they are unable due to medical conditions.

                                                        The order gives more control to Trump over independent agencies like the SEC, FTC, NLRB, and FCC.

                                                        Traditionally, these agencies have been independent from the president to avoid being politically pressured during their missions.
                                                        Prior administrations allowed independent agencies to work without political interference, this order allows Trump to exert more political influence on independent agencies by having a political representative in each agency.

                                                        Humphrey's Executor says that the president cannot fire appointed leaders of federal agencies without cause.
                                                        However, unitary executive theorists say that the president should be able to fire agency heads at will, saying he has the power through the constitution.
                                                        William Humphrey an FTC chair and FDR tried to fire him in 1933 to put someone new who agreed with the New Deal.
                                                        Humphrey refused but died a year later, but the Supreme Court ruled that the person administering his estate (Humphrey's executor) was entitled to his back pay since the law establishing the FTC was constitutional and that FDR's action was improper.

                                                        Those granted parole for at least a year are "qualified non-citizens," making them eligible for Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (child coverage if you make too much for Medicaid), but only after 5 years

                                                        Some undocumented workers obtain jobs by using fake or borrowed Social Security numbers and pay into Social Security, but are not eligible to receive social security benefits under current law.

                                                        On April 24, 2025, US District Judge William Orrick in San Fran issued a preliminary injunction at the request of request of 16 sanctuary cities and counties nationally
                                                        In the ruling Orrick said that Trump's order likely unconstitutionally imposed conditions on federal funding without congressional authorization and ran afoul of the localities' due process rights.
                                                        The cities all have laws and policies that limit or prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal officers with civil immigration arrests.
                                                        Orrick previously ruled against a similar EO from Trump's first term, the ruling was upheld in an appeals court.

                                                        Trump also said that the GSA was going to terminate 1,100 leases for office space by the end of the year.

                                                        On Mar 10, 2025, the USDA cut the $660 million Local Food for Schools program and the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program, which would have funded about $500 million in 2025 to support food banks.
                                                        The cuts further strained US food banks, which help fight hunger in the US, who had already been strained by inflation and COVID.

                                                        Farmers who have trouble accessing credit normally go to the USDA for loans for operational expenses including seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, or to buy land. 
                                                        The USDA services about 8% to 10% of farms with loans.

                                                        The order allows agancies to still provide documents and services in languages other than English however.
                                                        Before the order, 20 US states already had English designated as its official language.
                                                        Critics of the order say that designating only one official language could further marginalize minirities who don't speak English.

                                                        Howell said "I am sure many in the legal profession are watching in horror about what Perkins Coie is going through here."
                                                        The TRO blocked that part of the EO that sought to prevent the firm from doing business with federal contractors and to deny its lawyers access to government officials and buildings.
                                                        The order didn't apply to the revocation of security clearances.
                                                        On May 2, 2025, Howell struck down Trump's order due to free speech and due process violations, saying "Settling personal vendettas by targeting a disliked business or individual for punitive government action is not a legitimate use of the powers of the U.S. government or an American President."

                                                        Schwartz was charged in 2019 and pleaded not guilty to violating the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in a bribery scheme in India. 
                                                        The Trump administration ordered a review of pending prosecutions under the foreign bribery law in EO 14209.
                                                        According to a DOJ filing, Schwartz "is concerned that the firm's continued representation of him may negatively affect his ability to obtain a favorable review of his case."

                                                        Voice for America is under the he United States Agency for Global Media.
                                                        Trump had previously made Kari Lake the head of VOA for his second term.
                                                        On May 7, 2025, Lake announced that VOA would continue to provide newsfeed services but would contract the work out to the right-wing Trump-partisan OAN.
                                                        The contracting came despite Lake previously saying VOA would be doing their news content following the cancellation of contracts with AP and Reuters.

                                                        The dismantiling of US government-funded news outlets, including Voice of America and Radio Free Asia, were a blow to US soft-power, opening the door for China to strengthen their sphere of influence.
                                                        Voice of America was originally made to combat Nazi propoganda during WW2.
                                                        VOA now gives free press in authoritarian regimes including Russia and in Ukraine, while RFA gives free press in China and North Korea.
                                                        China's Global Times tabloid rejoiced at VOA's closure, calling it a "lie factory."
                                                        Cambodia's longtime authoritarian leader Hun Sen praised Trump's move to dismantle the news outlets, saying they were a "major contribution to eliminating fake news, disinformation, lies, distortions, incitement and chaos around the world."
                                                        RFA had been a thorn in Beijing's side, with its Uyghur-speaking journalists helping to document what Rubio has called a "genocide" against the Muslim minority group.

                                                        Oetken said in the ruling that Congress approved and funded VOA so only they could dismantle it.
                                                        On April 22, 2025, US District Judge Royce Lamberth ordered Trump to halt its efforts to shut down Voice of America, Radio Free Asia and Middle East Broadcasting Networks, saying he needed to restore the employees and contractors of the orgs due to their broadcasts being mandated by Congress.
                                                        On April 29, 2025, Lamberth ordered Trump to restore $12 million in funding to Radio Free Europe, saying Congress having funding powers.
                                                        Lamberth said Trump should not have signed the continuing resolution in Mar 2025 that included Global media funding if he wanted to cut it.
                                                        On May 3, 2025, an appeals court ruled 2-1 to block Lamberth's order on VOA workers return and funding restore for Radio Free Asia, saying that Lamberth didn't have the jurisdiction.

                                                        The lawsuit stated that Congress created the agencies and set their funding levels, so Trump had no power to order that their work be halted.
                                                        McConnell agreed, saying that federal law includes a mechanism for the president to return unneeded funding to Congress but Trump failed to follow that process.

                                                        In the EO, Trump called for "common sense" investments by state and local governments to address risks like wildfires, hurricanes, and cyber attacks to enhance national security, but did not detail how they would be funded.

                                                        Trump signed the order with a flank of students behind him in school desks.
                                                        The order aimed to leave school policy almost entirely in the hands of states and local boards.
                                                        Trump cannot dismantle the DOE without Congressional approval, which is unlikely.
                                                        However, he has already promised to fire half the staff at the DOE, which would effectively shutter the department.
                                                        According to a Rueters' poll, 65% of Americans oppose closing the DOE, with 30% in favor.

                                                        Student loan collections were paused in 2020 as relief during COVID.
                                                        At the time of the announcement, 5 million borrowers were in default and 4 million more were late on making payments.
                                                        The DoE said that if defaulters cannot pay, they will have their wages garnished to pay for the loans.

                                                        In 2024, China was the world's largets producer of these critical minerals, with the US alternatively producing very little.
                                                        Also in 2024, Beijing imposed an outright ban on exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the US.
                                                        Trump used the 1950 Defense Production Act (DPA), used by Harry Truman for the Korean War, to invoke wartime powers in order to carry out the EO.
                                                        Biden similarly used the DPA to carry out a similar program for critical minerals.

                                                        On Mar 20, 2025, Trump reversed the Paul Weiss EO, after Paul Weiss "acknowledged the wrongdoing" of an attorney who investigated Trump and also pledged $40 million in pro bono work for the government.
                                                        Paul Weiss already performed $130 million in pro bono work annually.
                                                        The move came after a meeting between the WH and Paul Weiss chairman, Brad Karp, who acknowledged the wrongdoing of Mark Pomerantz, a former partner at the New York firm, who was involved int Stormy Daniels case.
                                                        Leslie Levin, a University of Connecticut law professor and expert on the legal profession, said Paul Weiss likely feared a client exodus from the EO since most of their work requires security clearance.
                                                        After the deal between Trump and Paul Weiss, lawyers took to social media to criticise the firm for lacking courage and capitulating to Trump.
                                                        karp later said that Trump would not dictate what pro bono work they would be doing as part of the deal.

                                                        Imposed a 25% tariff on all goods coming into the US from any country that imports Venezualan oil.
                                                        Tariffs will only be lifted 1 year after the country stops importing Venezualan oil.
                                                        Cites Tren de Aragua and the Marudo regime as the reasoning.
                                                        Tariffs start April 2, 2025.

                                                        After the order, Trump extended the deadline to May 27 that he previously set to have Chevron stop operations in Venezuela.
                                                        Trump also said the tariffs would apply to countries indirectly buying Venezuelan oil.
                                                        Oil is Venezuela's main export, with China being the largest buyer with 503,000 barrels per day of Venezuelan crude and fuel, some 55% of total exports from Venezuela.
                                                        India, Spain, Italy and Cuba also consume Venezuelan oil.
                                                        The tariffs are likely to push China and India to just buy Russian oil instead.

                                                        <u>Election Fraud in the US</u>: 
                                                        Voting by non-citizens in the US is already illegal and rarely occurs.
                                                        The EO comes after Trump complained for years of voter fraud in his election loss to Biden.
                                                        With the EO, Trump showed he was done waiting for Congress to pass the SAVE Act, which would do the same thing as Trump's EO but be codified.
                                                        The EO has the possibility of disenfranchising voters, with 9% of Americans (21 mln people) not having proof of citizenship readily available.
                                                        The Constitution gives states authority to set the "times, places and manner" for elections, and gives Congress the power to regulate voting.

                                                        She declined to block parts of the order that sought to force states not to count mail-in ballots received after election day.

                                                        The memo directed Bondi to investigate and prosecute ActBlue and the other fundraisers.
                                                        It cites a congressional investigation that "revealed significant fraud schemes using ActBlue" as well as a 30-day period during the 2024 election when donations from foreign IPs using prepaid cards were detected.

                                                        Bates cited that the EO threatened the existence of the law firm, due to them not being able to access federal courthouses and 40% of their contracts coming from the federal government.

                                                        Trump targeted WilmerHale due to their ties to Robert Muller, who retired from the firm in 2021.

                                                        Under the emergency, imposes "reciprocal" 10% tariffs on all imports with further tariffs on 50+ countries (<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Annex-I.pdf" target="_blank">full list</a>) at a base rate of at least 10%. 
                                                        The tariffs go into effect on April 9, 2025.

                                                        In response automaker Stellantis said it would temporarily lay off U.S. workers and close plants in Canada and Mexico, while General Motors said it would increase U.S. production.
                                                        Howard Lutnick and senior trade adviser Peter Navarro both Trump would not back off, and that the tariff increases were not a negotiation.
                                                        However, Trump later said, "The tariffs give us great power to negotiate."
                                                        The Dow dropped 4% (worst since June 2020), the S&P500 dropped 5%, and the Nasdaq fell 6% (worst since March 2020) due to resurging inflation and recession worries.
                                                        For the week, the S&P 500 fell 9.08%, the Nasdaq declined 10.02%, and the Dow fell 7.86%. The Russell 2000 Small Cap Index dropped 9.70%, confirming a bear market.
                                                        Imports to the United States now face an average duty of 22.5%, up from 2.5% in 2024.
                                                        The tariffs also alienated allies in Asia and undercut US strategic efforts to contain China.
                                                        On April 28, 2025, UPS said they were laying off 20,000 people due to tariffs making them need to cut costs.

                                                        4 Republicans, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, joined all Dems in a 51-48 vote, the House is unlikely to pass the bill.
                                                        The bill aimed to terminate the national emergency Trump had delcared to impose the tariffs.
                                                        On April 3, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley and Democrat Maria Cantwell also introduced legislation that would require Trump to notify Congress on new tariffs with an explanation of the rationale and impact of them.
                                                        On April 30, 2025, following the first negative GDP print in 3 years, the Senate failed to pass, 49-49, a bill to overturn Trump's reciprocal tariffs by nullifying Trump's "national emergency". 
                                                        Then Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved to permanently kill the bill having Vance cast a 50-49 tiebreaking vote, since 2 votes in favor of the bill were not there and would be the next day.

                                                        Trump's formula for calculating the tariffs was to take the U.S. goods trade deficit with a country, divide it by that country's exports to the U.S. and turn it into a percentage figure; then cut that figure in half to produce the U.S. "reciprocal" tariff, with a floor of 10%.
                                                        This ended up making the uninhabited volcanic Australian territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands in the Antarctic, largely inhabited by penguins, have a 10% tariff.
                                                        This also disproportionately hurt the poorest countries in the world such as Madagascar (47% reciprocal tariff, $500 GDP per capita, $733 million of US exports), Lesotho (50% reciprocal tariff), Cambodia (49% reciprocal tariff).
                                                        These countries are so poor they cannot import any US goods due to them being so expensive (they aren't buying Teslas), so they got punished with the sharpest tariff rates as a result.

                                                        Powell's term ends in May 2026, when Trump will get to appoint a new chair.
                                                        In the coming weeks, Trump threatened that he could fire Powell if he wanted to and replace him with Kevn Warsh (former Fed governor) or Kevin Hassett (Trump econ adviser).
                                                        However, on April 22, 2025, Trump said "I have no intention of firing him," and "I would like to see him be a little more active in terms of his idea to lower interest rates," causing markets to jump.
                                                        On May 4, 2025, Trump fully backed off, saying it would be ridiculous to fire Powell but still called on him to lower rates.

                                                        In 2025, coal-burning plants generated less than 20% of U.S. electricity, a drop from 50% in 2000, due to more fracking, more use of solar/wind power, and regulations from Dems, including Biden.
                                                        This EO uses the 1950 Defense Production Act to boost coal production.
                                                        Coal releases more of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel when burned and emits pollutants linked to lung and heart diseases.

                                                        On April 15, 2025, Trump exempted 47 companies from regulations to curb mercury and air toxics for their coal-fired power plants.
                                                        The SC previously declined to block the Biden-era Mercury and Air Toxics Standard that required constant monitoring of emissions.
                                                        Mercury and other air toxics associated with coal burning raise the risk of asthma attacks, strokes, heart attacks and lung cancer.

                                                        Part 90 is a federal program ran by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) which relocates coal miners diagnosed with black lung to safer jobs at the same pay.
                                                        However, as part of the DOGE cuts, the Part 90 program was halted due to staff cuts (875 of 1000 NIOSH workers were fired by DOGE).
                                                        The cuts also shut down a seperate decades-old program to help detect black lung in coal miners
                                                        NIOSH estimates that 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia suffer from black lung, the highest rate in 25 years.
                                                        The cuts also affected MHSA, including coal mine inspectors who enforce coal safety regulations, the cuts will make it almost impossible to enforce the regulations now.
                                                        On April 29, 2025, NIOSH rehired 40 employees who worked on coal miner health and firefighter fatality prevention programs.
                                                        On May 3, 2025, Trump again fired 2 of the 40 NIOSH workers that had been asked back and said they were cutting the coal miner health and firefighter programs.
                                                        On May 13, 2025, over 100 federal employees who screen coal miners for black lung disease were permanently reinstated.

                                                        The regulation limited the flow for each showerhead on the market to 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) of water per minute.

                                                        In Trump's first term, he criticized Congress for delaying foreign arms sales over human rights or other concerns.
                                                        In 2019, Trump infuriated lawmakers (including Rebuplicans) when he declared a national emergency because of Iran, allowing him to sidestep Congress and sent $8 bln in weapons to Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Jordan.
                                                        Congress was blocking the sale due to the civilian death toll in teh Saudi campaign on Yemen and human rights abuses such as the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.

                                                        The directive covers all regulations under the Federal Power Act, the Natural Gas Act and the Power Plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act.

                                                        The EO included million-dollar U.S. port docking fees for Chinese vessels.

                                                        US shipbuilding peaked in the 1970s but declined due to high costs and a complex regulatory structure.

                                                        The Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program was from Biden's Inflation Reduction Act.
                                                        When drugs have no competition, the INA now allows the government to negotiate prices for complex biologic/biotech, drugs after 13 years on the market, but after 9 years for drugs taken as pills and capsules.
                                                        Since its signing, drugmakers have been lobbying to delay the timeline for price negotiations for small molecule drugs (primarily pills and account for most medicines) to 13 years as well.
                                                        The EO gives the drugmakers a win by pushing for Congress to revamp the program with this change.

                                                        The ordering of the investigation was seen as a an escalation and precursor to Trump issuing new critical mineral tariffs.
                                                        Manufacturers, industry consultants, and academics have long warned that the US is too reliant on foreign imports of critical minerals that power the entire US economy.
                                                        China is the top producer of 30 of the 50 critical minerals.
                                                        After Trump's reciprocal tariffs, China imposed restrictions on rare earths (group of 17 elements used across the defense, electric vehicle, energy and electronics) to the US, showing their ability to weaponize their critical mineral dominance.

                                                        <u>US Fishing Industry</u>: 
                                                        The EO marked a shift in US policy away from efforts to increase fish supply to prioritizing commerical fishing intrests.
                                                        Trump cited the $20 bln US trade deficit in fishing as a reason for his order, the US iports 90% of its seafood despite controlling over 4 mln sq miles of prime fishing grounds.
                                                        Since 1976, US fishing has been governed by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, which intended to combat overfishing.
                                                        Under the act, NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service develops management plans for 45 fisheries, setting quotas and determining the start and close of fishing seasons, after talking to researchers and local fisherman.
                                                        The list of overfished list grew from 40 in 2013 to 47 in 2023, overfishing had led to the destruction of the Maine shrip, Alantic cod, and partially the West Coast salmon industry.
                                                        The US has a $320 million fishing industry, the Trump admin's regulatory freeze injected chaos that delayed the opening of some East Coast fisheries and led to overfishing of Atlantic bluefin tuna.

                                                        The monument was designated by Obama in 2016 to protect species including deep-sea corals, sea turtles and whales, Trump reopened it in 2020 but Biden again reversed it in 2021.

                                                        Disparate-impact liability is the idea that racism, sexism, or some other form of discrimination can occur without explicit intent.
                                                        It was created as a liability path in the 1971 SC case Griggs v. Duke Power, where the court said that otherwise neutral employment practices can violate the Civil Rights Act when they disproportionately affect a protected group and are not demonstrably related to job performance.
                                                        In 1991, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act to explicitly protects against practices seen in Griggs.
                                                        Prior to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), women could be asked to have a male relative or spouse co-sign for their credit cards or loans.
                                                        In the EO, Trump tries to argue that it is somehow violating civil rights law and the Constitution to require employers or housing providers to consider the disparate impact on race or gender or age, right or disability.
                                                        The EO is likely to make sure that women have equal access to credit, that Black people have equal access to credit.

                                                        Presidents have issued EOs related to HBCUs, with variations in title and scope, since President Jimmy Carter began formally centering HBCUs in federal policy in 1980.
                                                        However, Trump's EO lacks a commitment to new federal funding, compared to Biden's pairing his 2021 executive order with nearly $1.6 billion in funding announced within a week of the executive order. 
                                                        Trump later released a fact sheet refrerring to HBCU-related funding from his first term.
                                                        Between 2021 and 2024, Biden directed $17 billion, including $1.3 billion in 2024 alone.
                                                        As of 2025, many HBCUs still struggle with inadequate infrastructure, lower faculty pay, and limited state investment, especially compared to nearby HWIs.

                                                        College accreditation is a requirement for accessing federal student financial aid.
                                                        The federal government does not directly accredit U.S. universities but has a role in overseeing the mostly private organizations that do so.
                                                        Under the Higher Education Act of 1965, the education secretary "recognizes" over 30 private educational associations, as well as some agencies run by state governments, that can accredit colleges through a peer review process if they meet criteria laid out by Congress.
                                                        The Higher Education Act says the main role of accreditors is to ensure the quality of education and to serve as a guarantor of the diplomas issued by accredited schools.
                                                        The Higher Education Act requires institutions provide info for current and prospective students on "student body diversity," including a breakdown of the gender and racial makeup of full-time students.
                                                        Trump has often complained that accreditors approve institutions that fail to provide quality education and promote "leftist" ideology.

                                                        On April 25, 2025, the Dept of Education launched an investigation into the University of California, Berkeley's foreign funding disclosures.
                                                        The investigation came after a review found Berkeley's disclosures to the government may be "incomplete or inaccurate."

                                                        The EO orders the expidition of seabed mining permits "in areas beyond the national jurisdiction," a move likely to spark friction with the international community.
                                                        Any country can allow deep-sea mining in its own territorial waters, roughly up to 200 nautical miles from shore.
                                                        The order is another push by Trump to onshore critical mineral production from China, who restricted exports to the US in recent months due to tariffs.

                                                        Most probationary workers are longtime government employees in new roles.

                                                        He did this by allowing them to offset tariffs for imported auto parts used in U.S.-assembled vehicles equal to 3.75% of the total value of the suggested retail price of vehicles they build in the U.S. through April 2026, and 2.5% of U.S. production through April 30, 2027.
                                                        The order came as the 25% auto tariffs already hurt the auto industry and US auto leaders lobbied Trump heavily to provide them relief.

                                                        The LA VA said that parts of the campus were being leased to a private school/companies, as well as the UCLA baseball team.

                                                        Trump said he was seeking cuts of between 59% and 90%.
                                                        The US pays the highest prices for prescription drugs, often nearly three times more than other developed nations.
                                                        During Trump's first term, he signed a similar EO but was stopped from implementing it by the courts.

                                            <li>The 14 rioters not fully pardoned, all members of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, were not fully pardoned but will have their sentences ended early and will be freed from federal prison</li>
                                            <li>Trump also ordered the Attorney General to drop all pending cases related to the riot</li>
                                            <li>The White House released a proclamation for the pardons, which called the investigation into the riot a "grave national injustice" and said the pardons would begin a "process of national reconciliation"</li>
                                            <li>Many Trump allies didn't expect such broad pardons, including Vice President JD Vance who previously said "If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned"</li>
                                            <li>The decision was criticized by the Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the largest police union in the US. </li>

                                            <li>A Reuters poll found that 60% of Americans say Trump should not have pardoned all the rioters</li>
                                            <li>Among those released were Stewart Rhodes and Enrique Tarrio. Rhodes was the former leader of the far-right Oath Keepers and was sentenced to 18 years for plotting to use force to prevent the certification of the 2020 election, Trump only commuted his sentence and didn't give him a full pardon. Tarrio was the former leader of the far-right Proud Boys group and was sentenced to 22 years after being convicted of seditious conspiracy for planning the Jan 6 attack.</li>
                                            <li>After the pardons, a federal judge imposed restrictions on Rhodes and 7 other Oath Keepers who were convicted of seditious conspiracy that they needed court approval before being able to enter the Capitol in Washington. However, the judge dropped the restrictions a few days later after finding that Trump's pardons also released them from a term of court supervision.</li>

                                        Ulbricht was found guilty of charges including distributing drugs through the internet and conspiring to commit computer hacking and money laundering.
                                        Prosecutors said some people had died from the drugs they had bought on the Silk Road site, and that Ulbricht also ordered the murder of several people to keep the site running (though there is no evidence the murders were actually carried out). 
                                        Trump had promised to pardon Ulbricht on the campaign trail while at the Libertarian National Convention.

                                        Handy was convicted along with 9 co-defendants who also took part in the blockade on the Washington Surgi-Clinic that lasted for several hours.

                                        Blagojevich was convicted of corruption after trying to sell Obama's vacated US Senate seat after he won the 2008 Presidential election.
                                        In 2018, the Supreme Court rejected Blagojevich's bid to have his sentence reduced.
                                        Trump had communted Blagojevich's 14-year sentence during his first term.

                                        In 2020, his conviction was overturned but then reinstated by a court of appeals.

                                        Archer told the committee that Joe Biden was never directly involved in their financial dealings, though Hunter would often put his father on speakerphone to impress clients.

                                        In 2023, Milton was sentenced to 4 years in prison after a jury trial found him guilty for lying to investors about hist company's technology. 
                                        Milton misled investors saying Nikola had built a pickup from the "ground up," that it had developed its own batteries even though he knew it was buying them, and that it had early success creating a "Nikola One" semi-truck that he knew did not work.
                                        A company video of a prototype truck appearing to be driven down a desert highway was actually a video of a nonfunctioning Nikola that had been rolled down a hill.
                                        In Oct 2024, Milton and his wife donated more than $1.8 million to the Trump re-election campaign.

                                        She was found guilty in Oct 2024 for federal wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
                                        Fiore had a campaign ad in 2022 where she steps out of a Ford F-150 with a handgun holstered on her hip and tells viewers she was one of the first elected officials to endorse Trump in 2016.
                                        In 2022, she lost a bid for state treasurer and was instead appointed as a judge in deep-red Nye County, despite not having a law degree.
                                        While serving as a state lawmaker, Fiore gained national attention for supporting rancher Cliven Bundy and his family during armed standoffs between militiamen and federal law enforcement officers in Bunkerville, Nevada, in 2014 and Malheur, Oregon, in 2016.

                                                Trump said in a Truth Social post "If we don't make a 'deal,' and soon, I have no other choice but to put high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions on anything being sold by Russia to the United States, and various other participating countries."
                                                The post came after Trump spent the entire campaign trail saying he would have a deal between the countries by his first day in office, which his admin now conceeded with take months or longer.

                                                On Feb 6, 2025, AG Pam Bondi ordered the DOJ to disband the Task Force KleptoCapture, which was established after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine to sanction and target oligarchs close to the Kremlin.
                                                Bondi said that resources being used to target the Russian oligarchs would be transferred to targeting drug cartels at the US border. 
                                                The task force brought indictments against aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska and TV tycoon Konstantin Malofeyev for sanctions busting, and seized yachts belonging to sanctioned oligarchs Suleiman Kerimov and Viktor Vekselberg.
                                                The cases being investigated by the task force are likely to continue, but no longer be at the DOJ.
                                                The disbanding of the task force is likely to bring a sharp decline in the pace of charges brought on Russian oligarchs.

                                                After the calls, Trump ordered his officials (Rubio, Ratcliffe, and Witkoff) to begin talks to end the Russia-Ukraine war.
                                                Earlier on the same day, Hegseth said that Ukraine would have to forget joining NATO and would have to forget getting their territory back that was taken by Russia and that there would be no US security troops sent to Ukraine.
                                                However, a day later John Coale, President Donald Trump's deputy Ukraine envoy, said that NATO membership and pre-2014 borders were still on the table.
                                                After Trump's remarks, Britain, France and Germany all said they needed to be part of the ceasefire talks.
                                                Later the next day, Zelenskiy said that the US, Europe and Ukraine need a common position before talks with Moscow, after Trump suggested setting up talks at the upcoming Munich security confrence.

                                                Ahead of the talks, Russian FM Lavrov said that Russia would not concede any territory to Ukraine, that no NATO country troops should be stationed in Ukraine, and that Europe should not play any role in the talks, setting a hard opening stance.
                                                Rubio said that the EU was not being sidelined and that the EU would be involved at some point.
                                                Russia also said that they not only wanted Ukraine to not join NATO, they wanted the US to withdraw a 2008 promise they made that Ukraine could join in the future.
                                                Ukraine was not present at the talks and said they would not accept any deal unless they were part if the negotiations.
                                                Rubio said during the meeting they discussed increasing embassy staffing at each other's embassies and to explore closer relations, including dropping sanctions.
                                                While the meeting was ongoing, Russia continued to bomb Ukrainian cities, killing civilians including children.

                                                Russia released Ksenia Karelina, a dual US-Russia citizen who was found guilty in 2024 of treason by a Russian court for donating $51.80 to a U.S.-based charity providing humanitarian support to Ukraine.
                                                The US released Arthur Petrov, a dual German-Russian citizen arrested in 2023 in Cyprus at the request of the U.S. for allegedly exporting sensitive microelectronics.

                                                The comments came as there was growing frusturation in the WH over Russia's unwillingness to end the war and with Zelensky's comments earlier in the week that Witkoff was "spreading Russian narratives."
                                                The comments also came after the WH said they were ready to recognize Crimea as Russian territory.
                                                On April 20, 2025, Putin declared an "Easter ceasefire," that would take place over the next day until Easter Sunday was over.
                                                On Easter Sunday, Ukraine said Russia had continued atrillery attacks and Russia said that Ukraine forces continued to fight including along the Crimean border and in Kursk.

                                                The rebuke came a day after Trump criticised Zelenskiy for saying Ukraine would not recognize Russia's occupation of Crimea.
                                                Trump sayd Crimea was lost years ago "and is not even a point of discussion."

                                                Trump began the exchange saying that Zelenskiy was a dictator for not having elections and that the only thing Zelenskiy "was good at was playing Biden 'like a fiddle.'"
                                                Trump also said Zelenskiy had a 4% approval rating (current polling showed it was actually 57%) and that Ukraine "should have never started" the war and "could have made a deal" to prevent it.
                                                Zelenskiy responded by saying "We have seen this disinformation. We understand that it is coming from Russia," and that Trump "lives in this disinformation space."

                                                The exchange started when Zelensky tried to persuade Trump not to side with Putin and asked JD Vance how the US was going to give a security guarantee, "What kind of diplomacy are you talking about, JD?"
                                                Vance responded by calling Zelensky disrespectful and ungrateful for US support, acting as an attack dog for Trump, "I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country."
                                                After the meeting, Zelensky was asked by Trump to leave the WH early and the mineral deal was not signed, despite the Ukrainans wanting to continue the talks.
                                                The outburst occured after weeks of increasing tensions, with Trump and Zelensky trading blows on social media; Trump also told his team to limit communications with Zelenskiy's top aide Andriy Yermak and tried to get Ukrainian elections as part of a peace deal to see Zelensky ousted.
                                                European leaders responded to the meeting by rushing to support Zelensky, including newly elected German chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz, Canada's Trudeau, UK PM Starmer, and France's Macron.
                                                US Dem lawmakers condemed Trump for the meeting, while Republicans were split with some backing Kyiv and others backing Trump, dimming the prospect of future US aid to Ukraine. 
                                                After the meeting Trump tweeted "I have determined that President Zelenskyy is not ready for Peace if America is involved ... He can come back when he is ready for Peace."
                                                Hours after the meeting, Zelenskiy said in an interview by Fox News "Yes of course" that his relationship with Trump could be salvaged, adding "I'm sorry for this."
                                                Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said Zelensky had received a "brutal dressing down," after the meeting.

                                                On Feb 5, 2025, Trump said he envisioned the US taking over Gaza and transforming it into the "Riviera of the Middle East" resort where international communities could coexist after the destruction of the Gaza war.
                                                Trump originally said that Palestinians should be permanently removed from Gaza but his press secratary Karoline Leavitt walked back Trump's assertion saying that instead they should be "temporarily relocated" for the rebuilding process.
                                                Jordan and Egypt both said they didn't back displacing Palestinians in response to the comments.
                                                Saudi Arabia said they would refuse to establish ties with Israel if Trump went through with the plan and without the creation of a Palestinian state.
                                                Ben-Gvir, a far-right Israeli lawmaker, said "encouraging" Gazans to emigrate was the only correct strategy at the end of the Gaza war and urged Netanyahu to adopt the policy "immediately."
                                                The plan was also praised by PM Netanyahu, who said "Give them a choice. Not forcible eviction. Not ethnic cleansing."
                                                Analysts suspect that Trump only made the comments to increase leverage to use as a negotiating tool in later negotiations.
                                                On Feb 9, 2025, Trump repeated his plan to take over Gaza, saying "I'm committed to buying and owning Gaza. As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle East to build sections of it, other people may do it, through our auspices. But we're committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn't move back."

                                                Also on Mar 14, 2025, the AP reported that Trump and Israel officials had contacted Sudan, Somalia and the breakaway region of Somalia known as Somaliland asking them to potentially take in Palestinians as part of a postwar plan in Gaza.
                                                Since all three places are poor, and wracked by violence, the proposal also casts doubt on Trump's stated goal of resettling Gazans in a "beautiful area."
                                                Sudan said they had rejected the US offer while Somalia and Somaliland said they were unaware of any offer.
                                                US and Israel officials confirmed the Somalia and Somaliland contracts and only US officials confirmed the Sudan contract.
                                                Sudan was previously among the countries in the 2020 Abraham Accords.

                                                Alexander was the last living US hostage still being kept by Hamas, who said they released him as a good-will gesture to Trump, who was visiting the Gulf States that week.
                                                The release came after four-way talks between Hamas, the US, Egypt and Qatar, with Qatar and Egypt saying Alexander's release was an encouraging step towards new truce talks.
                                                After the release, Netanyahu said there will be no ceasefire and that plans to intensify military action in Gaza will continue.

                                                The Chinese tariffs in US goods include a 15% levy on U.S. coal and LNG and 10% for crude oil, farm equipment and a small number of trucks as well as big-engine sedans.
                                                The limited response from Chine underscores their attempt to engage Trump in talks, which were not yet scheduled, before engaging in an all out trade war.

                                                The Chinese retaliatory tariffs included 15% on US-made chicken, wheat, corn and cotton, and 10% on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, seafood, fruit, vegetables and dairy.

                                                China said this would be the last time they responded to a US tariff increase and they would begin working with the EU and Asia to fight the US further.

                                            <li>On Feb 1, 2025, Trump started a trade war by imposing a 25% tariff on all goods coming from Canada, except energy goods, which only got a 10% tariff.
                                                Trump cited Canada's failure to curb fentanyl flow into the US as why he imposed the tariffs.
                                                Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, said Canada would respond with tariffs on $155 billion of US goods, including beer, wine, lumber and appliances, beginning with $30 billion taking effect 2/4/25 and $125 billion 21 days later.
                                                Trudeau urged Canadians to forego travel to the US and boycott US products.
                                                Trudeau also said how him and many Canadians felt beytrayed, reminding Americans that Canadian troops fought alongside them in Afghanistan and helped respond to myriad crises from wildfires in California to Hurricane Katrina. 
                                                Canada and Mexico said they will be working together against Trump's tariffs.
                                                Trump had previously floated the idea also that Canada should become the 51st state of the US.
                                                However, after negotiations, Trump agreed to pause the tariffs for 1 month due to Canada offering a $900 million border security package and a new "fentanyl czar".

                                            <li>On 2/1/2025, Trump started a trade war with Mexico by imposing 25% tariffs on all Mexico imports, including oil, citing a national emergency from fentanyl and illegal immigration flow into the US.
                                                Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum ordered retalitory tariffs in reponse to Trump, without specifying how much or on what goods. 
                                                Sheinbaum also rejected as "slander" the White House's allegation that drug cartels have an alliance with the Mexican government, which Trump had claimed as justification for the tariffs.
                                                Canada and Mexico said they will be working together against Trump's tariffs.
                                                However, after negotiations, Trump agreed to pause the tariffs for 1 month due to Mexico sending 10,000 national guard troops to the border.

                                            <li>In Jan 2025, Trump began sending deported migrant flights using military aircraft from the US to Columbia.
                                                This resulted in the Columbian President Gustavo Petro to reject the flights, saying they were inhumane.
                                                Trump reacted to this by threatening 25% tariffs on all Colombian goods coming into the U.S. (US is Colombia's largest trade partner), which would go up to 50% in one week; a travel ban and visa revocations on Colombian government officials; and emergency treasury, banking and financial sanctions.
                                                Petro announced a retaliatory 25% increase in Colombian tarrifs on US good following Trump's tariff announcement.
                                                Colombia is the fourth-largest overseas supplier of crude oil and also the largest supplier of fresh cut flowers to the US.
                                                Eventually, an agreement was made to transport the migrants back to Colombia on military planes, though Colombia said their presidential plane was open to be used to transport the deportees.
                                                After the agreement, Trump dropped his threats, stepping back from the brink of a trade-war.
                                                Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the U.S. from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador.

                                                On 2/2/25, Marco Rubio told Panama President Jose Raul Mulino that the US would "take measures necessary" if Panama doesn't take steps to end what Trump sees as Chinese influence over the Panama Canal.
                                                Mulino signaled he would review agreements involving China and Chinese businesses following the talks with Rubio.
                                                Mulino also said he would consider terminating an agreement between Panama and China to contribute to China's Belt and Road initiative.
                                                Rubio said Trump thinks that China's presence - through a Hong Kong-based company operating two ports near the canal's entrances - was a threat to the waterway and a violation of the U.S.-Panama neutrality treaty.
                                                Trump commented on the Canal by saying "China's running the Panama Canal. That was not given to China, that was given to Panama - foolishly - but they violated the agreement, and we're going to take it back, or something very powerful is going to happen."
                                                In 2021, the Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings renewed a 25 year concession for operation of 2 ports at both entrances of the canal, which said could allow China to close the canal to US traffic if the US and China entered into a war.
                                                However, Panama says the ports are not part of the canal's operation and that the ports are operated by the Panama Canal Authority, an autonomous agency overseen by the Panamanian government.

                                                US military vessels do have priority of passage through the waterway, according the 1977 neutrality treaty, but still have to pay their toll.
                                                Marco Rubio later said in a press confrence that it was "absurd" that the US Navy pay to use the canal.

                                            Hegseth said the strikes were directed by Trump and coordinated with the Somalian government.
                                            The Pentagon said that multiple ISIL operatives were killed and that no civilians were harmed in the strikes.
                                            The strikes come after previous ones on Jan 30 in northwest Syria on Hurras al-Din operatives.

                                                In Feb 2025, Japanese PM Shigeru Ishiba visited Trump, in which Trump announced that $14.9 billion bid for US Steel would take the form of an investment instead of a purchase.
                                                However, sources still said Nippon had still not withdrawn their bid.
                                                Trump mistakenly referred to Nippon as "Nissan" during his remarks.
                                                Before the 2024 election, the buyout became highly politicized, with both Trump and Biden vowing to kill the deal.
                                                Biden also in Jan 2025 blocked the $14.9 billion deal from going through.

                                                The US would keep the base 10% tariff, reduce tariffs on some UK-made cars from 27.5% to 10%, reduce steel tariffs from 25% to 0%, reduce plane part tariffs to 0%, 
                                                The UK would buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, remove all tariffs on ethanol (used in beer) from 19%, still not allow US beef imports with growth hormones.

                                                    Ibarra was waived a right to a jury trial and sentenced to life without parole after being found guilty.

                                                    This is because a migrant only has to be <i>charged</i> with a crime, meaning if anyone <i>accuses</i> them of one they will be deported with no due process.
                                                    Those in opposition also criticised the bills lack of funding and that it would not solve the root of the immigration problem.

                                        Trump had previously threatened Zuckerberg with <a href="https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/uOazATi8RTkPgCl30ZFlLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTg5NQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thedailybeast.com/760a1612843a9b508cff394bd14e4242" target="_blank">imprisonment</a>.
                                        In Jan 2025, Meta ended its DEI program and scrapped its US fact checking program, while allowing more discussion on immigration and gender.
                                        In Jan, Meta also named prominent Republican Joel Kaplan as its chief global affairs officer and elected Dana White, CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and close friend of Trump, to its board.
                                        On 1/29/2025, Meta settled a lawsuit with Trump over his banning on Meta and Facebook due to Jan 6.

                                        Musk dismissed criticism of the hand gesture as a "tired" attack.
                                        Musk made the gesture twice before saying, "My heart goes out to you. It is thanks to you that the future of civilization is assured."
                                        The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitism said in response to the gesture "It seems that @elonmusk made an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute, but again, we appreciate that people are on edge."
                                        Musk has backed the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), an anti-immigration, anti-Islamic party labeled as right-wing-extremist by German security services.
                                        In Feb 2025, Musk's X platform settled a lawsuit with Trump agreeing to pay him $10 million, the lawsuit was for Trump's suspension from twitter after Jan 6.

                                            <li>Since the 1980's, pilots have been rasing alarms over close calls (26 incidents in total) involving helicopters at Reagan airport.</li>
                                            <li>Immediately after the crash, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) opened an investigation into the cause of the collision.</li>
                                            <li>The day after the crash, Trump seemingly blamed the Black Hawk crew by saying they were flying over their altitude limit. US military helicopters normally fly a route over the Potomac River, known as Route 4, where the altitude for helicoper flights is capped at 200 feet, the Blackhawk was flying at 278 feet.</li>
                                            <li>Both Hegseth and the Army said the three-member crew of soldiers on the Black Hawk were experienced, with the designated pilot having 1000 flying hours and the other pilot having 500.</li>
                                            <li>Trump also suggested, with no evidence and while bodies were still being recovered, that DEI efforts in the FAA were the cause of the crash, then sent a memo to his admin to assess and undo any DEI initiatives in aviation safety roles.</li>
                                            <li>Trump's comments at address on the crash: "The FAA diversity push includes focus on hiring people with severe intellectual and psychiatric disabilities. That is amazing," Trump said, claiming the FAA wanted people "with severe disabilities, the most underrepresented segment of the workforce, and they want them in and they want them - they can be air traffic controllers."</li>
                                            <li>After being asked how he could blame the crash on DEI despite not knowing who was at fault, Trump replied "because I have common sense."</li>
                                            <li>Trumps comments came despite there being a recording of an air traffic controller alerting the Blackhawk of the CRJ700's presence and asking the Army helicopter to pass behind the regional jet 2 minutes before the crash.</li>
                                            <li>Also on the day after the crash, Trump appointed a former senior aviation official, Chris Rocheleau, as the acting head of the FAA. The previous FAA administrator from Biden's term, Mike Whitaker, stepped down after Trump took office on Jan 20.</li>
                                            <li>At the time of the crash, the FAA was 3000 controllers under their staffing targets at 10700 controllers.</li>
                                            <li>In Feb 6, 2025, it Ted Cruz said that the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, or ADS-B, tracking technology on the Black Hawk was turned off at the time of the crash, Cruz is a member of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, which received a closed-door briefing on the crash by the NTSB.</li>
                                            <li>On Feb 14, 2025, the NTSB said a preliminary analysis of the voice recordings and altitude data from the Black Hawk showed the pilots were given false altitude readings.</li>

                                        ICE had arrested 48 illegal immigrants, 20 of them with criminal convictions, during raids in NM that month.
                                        A man was later arrested in connection to the arson in April 2025.

                                    <li>On April 13, 2025 a man filled beer bottles with gasoline and used them to set Democrat Pennsylvania governor Josh Shapiro's house on fire before fleeing.
                                        Shapiro and his family were sleeping at the time and were not injured.
                                        The man, Cody Balmer, turned himself in the next morning saying he "harbored hate" toward the governor and planned to beat him with a hammer if he encountered him.
                                        He was later charged with attempted homicide, terrorism, aggravated arson and other felonies.

                                        In June 2022, he posted a green bottle with flames shooting from it and the words: "Be the light you want to see in the world."

                                        He said that he "needs to stop having my friends killed," and "our people have been put through too much by that monster."
