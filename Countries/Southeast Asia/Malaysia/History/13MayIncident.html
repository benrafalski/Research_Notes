    <h2>13 May Inciden</h2>
    <h3>DAP and Gerakan</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Democratic Action Party (DAP) was founded in October 1965 by a Malaya-based member of the PAP from Singapore and was effectively the successor to the PAP after Singapore was expelled in 1964</li>
        <li>The DAP is a center left social democratic political party and campaigned against Bumiputra privileges</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>1969 General Election</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the lead up to the 1969 elections the DAP, Gerakan, and People's Progressive Party ran together in a electoral pact</li>
        <li>The DAP won 13 Parliamentary seats and Gerakan won ??? seats</li>
        <li>In May 1969 in Malaysia and June/July in Sarawak/Sabah general elections were held</li>
        <li>The election resulted in the return to power of the Alliance Party (UMNO, MCA, MIC), although with a reduced majority (lost 2/3 majority required to pass contitutional amendments)</li>
        <li>The Gerakan Party and Democratic Action Party (DAP) campaigned against Bumiputra policies and made major gains</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nationwide Riots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On May 12 1969, the Gerakan and DAP held a victory rally in Kaula Lumpur</li>
        <li>On May 13, the UMNO had their own planned event and this is where the riots broke out between a group of Malays and a Chinese bystander, the fighting eventually spread to the rally causing the riot to rapidly spread through the entire city</li>
        <li>On May 14 and 16, the riots led the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (paramount ruler) to declare a state of emergency and suspend parliament after the army was deployed with a shoot to kill order and a curfew were enstated to quell the violence</li>
        <li>The press was also suspended by reinstaned on May 18 but then censored on May 21<li>
        <li>Many non-Malays disliked the UMNO's attempts to create a common Malay identity such as increasing the use of the Malay language</li>
        <li>In June 1969, the riots broke out again when Malays attacked Indians (killing 15) but they were ended quickly</li>
        <li>Reports placed the number dead at 196 but international observers said it was closer to 600, mostly ethnic Chinese</li>
        <li>Over 450 houses were also burned to the ground, mostly Chinese</li>
        <li>The NOC reported that "recial politics" were the main cause of the riots and were reluctant to assign blame to the Malays and also blamed  the Malayan Communist Party (MCP)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>National Operations Council (NOC)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Also called the Majlis Gerakan Negara (MAGERAN)</li>
        <li>After the state of emergency was declared, on May 15, Tunku was forced to step down as prime minister when parliament was suspended</li>
        <li>The NOC was the emergency government body led by Tun Abdul Razak and formed to restore law and order after Parliement was dissolved following the May 13 riots</li>
        <li>The goal of the NOC was to advance indigenous or ethnic Malay dominance (Ketuanan Melayu)</li>
        <li>From 1969-1971, the NOC governed Malaysia before the Parliament took over again</li>

    <h3>New Economic Policy (NEP)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic Policy launched by the NOC in 1971 to act as affirmative-action and to increase the wealth of the bumiputra (Malays)</li>
        <li>This would be done through affirmative-action in education and in civil service employment</li>
        <li>The NEP aimed to basically restructure society to minimize the level of poverty in the country in order to attain national unity</li>
        <li>The ethnic Malays and indigenous people of the time were mainly lower-class agricultural workers</li>
        <li>Until 1970, the Malaysian poverty rate was 49% with indigenous communities only holding 3% of the economy</li>
        <li>The Chinese were particularly worried about this policy</li>
        <li>The NEP policies would last for 20 years, started from with the launching of the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75) until the Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-90)</li>
        <li>One policy was to move wealth distribution ratios from 2.4:33:63 ratio of Bumiputra, Other Malaysian, Foreigner ownership to a 30:40:30 ratio</li>
        <li>The other major policy was to "expand the pie" where the Bumiputra share of hte economic growth would increse while the non-Bumiputra's share would remain the same</li>
        <li>Education also saw changes with affirmative action policies being added for Bumiputra</li>
        <li>Results: from 1970-97 bumiputra wealth went from 4% to 20%, GNP per capita went from 1142 ringgit to 12102 ringgit, and poverty dropped from 50% to 6.8% but it is unclear what role the NEP played in this, the NEP also resulted in a brain drain of Chinese and Indian professionals</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Political Restructuring and Ketuanan Melayu</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Islamic Movement</h3>
    <ul>
