    <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1969_Malaysian_general_election -->
    <h3>1969 General Election</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In May 1969 in Malaysia and June/July in Sarawak/Sabah general elections were held</li>
        <li>The election resulted in the return to power of the Alliance Party (UMNO, MCA, MIC), although with a reduced majority (lost 2/3 majority required to pass contitutional amendments)</li>
        <li>The Gerakan Party and Democratic Action Party (DAP) campaigned against Bumiputra policies and made major gains</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nationwide Riots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On May 12 1969, the Gerakan and DAP held a victory rally in Kaula Lumpur</li>
        <li>State of emergency</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>National Operations Council (NOC)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Also called the Majlis Gerakan Negara (MAGERAN)</li>
        <li>Emergency government body led by Tun Abdul Razak and formed to restore law and order after Parliement was dissolved following the May 13 riots</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>New Economic Policy (NEP)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Economic Policy launched by the NOC in 1971 to act as affirmative-action and to increase the wealth of the bumiputra (Malays)</li>
        <li>This would be done through affirmative-action in education and in civil service employment</li>
        <li>The NEP aimed to basically restructure society to minimize the level of poverty in the country in order to attain national unity</li>
        <li>The ethnic Malays and indigenous people of the time were mainly lower-class agricultural workers</li>
        <li>Until 1970, the Malaysian poverty rate was 49% with indigenous communities only holding 3% of the economy</li>
        <li>The Chinese were particularly worried about this policy</li>
        <li>The NEP policies would last for 20 years, started from with the launching of the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75) until the Fifth Malaysia Plan (1986-90)</li>
        <li>One policy was to move wealth distribution ratios from 2.4:33:63 ratio of Bumiputra, Other Malaysian, Foreigner ownership to a 30:40:30 ratio</li>
        <li>The other major policy was to "expand the pie" where the Bumiputra share of hte economic growth would increse while the non-Bumiputra's share would remain the same</li>
        <li>Education also saw changes with affirmative action policies being added for Bumiputra</li>
        <li>Results: from 1970-97 bumiputra wealth went from 4% to 20%, GNP per capita went from 1142 ringgit to 12102 ringgit, and poverty dropped from 50% to 6.8% but it is unclear what role the NEP played in this, the NEP also resulted in a brain drain of Chinese and Indian professionals</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Political Restructuring and Ketuanan Melayu</h3>
    <ul>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Islamic Movement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In the late 1970s, the dakwah or Islamic fundumentalist revival grew among the younger generation who disliked the westernization of Malay society</li>
    </ul>
