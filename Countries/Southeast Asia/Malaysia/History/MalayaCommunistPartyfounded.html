    <h2>Malaya Communist Party founded</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In April 1930, the South Seas Communist Party formed into the Communist Prty of Malaya</li>
        <li>The party was illegal under British rule</li>
        <li>Members were mostly Chinese students in their 20's</li>
        <li>Over the 1930's, they gained influence and organized various strikes</li>
        <li>By 1939, they had over 40,000 members</li>
        <li>After the Japanese invaded in 1941, the British accepted the MCP and the two allied to fight the Japanese</li>
        <li>The MCP would go on to form the MPAJA and be the main anti-Japanese militant group in Malaya during the war</li>
        <li>After the Japanese occupation ended, the British occupation started again and the MCP became anti-British again</li>
        <li>By 1948, the MCP ws at the forefront of the Malayan Emergency against the British colonial government</li>
        <li>The MCP formed the Malayan Peoples' Anti-British Army (MPABA) which turned into the 'Malayan National Liberation Army' (MNLA) to fight the British from the jungles</li>
        <li>By 1955, the MCP began to negotiate with the government after being suppresses militarily</li>
        <li>In 1957, Malaya became independet from Britain and in 1960 the emergency was declared over</li>
        <li>In 1960, the US estimated that the MCP had about 2,000 members</li>
        <li>In the early 1970s, the MCP only remained in Thailand and underwent many trials and executions after being accused of spying</li>
        <li>This caused the formation of two splinter groups in 1970: the Communist Party of Malaya/Marxist-Leninist and the Communist Party of Malaya/Revolutionary Faction</li>
        <li>The groups would eventually merge again in 1983 to form the Communist Party of Malaysia, which was dissolved in 1987</li>
    </ul>
