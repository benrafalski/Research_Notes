    <h2>Chinese immigration</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>During the 1800s, the Chinese began to immigrate to Malaysia and settled in the weaker sultanates (not Johor) to escape poverty at home.</li>
        <li>They formed tight communities and often mined tin.</li>
        <li>Some groups fought wars against each other and the Chinese did not integrate fully with the Malays, increasing friction between the ethnicities.</li>
        <li>They established Kuala Lumpur and Ipoh.</li>
    </ul>
