    <h2>Sarawak Self-government</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1841, Brooke Raj was established in Sarawak and Sarawak became a sovereign nation by the US in 1850 and the UK in 1864</li>
        <li>After WWII ended, Sarawak was ceded to Britain as a crown colony</li>
        <li>Following the cessasion of Sarawak to the British by Vyner Brooke, anti-cessasion protests among the local broke out in Sarawak</li>
        <li>The movement wanted to return to independece as they had under Brooke and eventually culminated in the murder of the second governor of British Sarawak, Duncan Stewart</li>
        <li>In July 1963, Sarawak achieved de facto self-government</li>
        <li>They appointed Stephen Kalong Ningkan (SNAP member) as first Chief Minister of Sarawak (head-of-state) and formed a new Cabinet of Sarawak (executive body)</li>
        <li>This was because Britain made them a self-governing colony where they were still a colony but was led by elected officials</li>
        <li>Britain made them self-governing with the expectation that they would become part of Malaysia later that year</li>
        <li>On September 16, 1963, Sarawak joined Malaysia during the formation of the Federation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In July 2016, Sarawak day was declared for the first time to celebrate Sarawak independence</li>
