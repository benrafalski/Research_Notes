    <h2>Secession of Singapore</h2>
    <h3>1964 Race Riots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Initially, Tunku rejected Lee Kuan Yew's proposal to join the Federation of Malaysia due to the large population of Chinese in Singpore</li>
        <li>However, Tunku changed his mind when Singpore leader Ong Eng Guan (anti-communist who had been expelled from the PAP) won by election as an independent</li>
        <li>July 1964 Riot</li>
        <li>September 1964 Riot</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PAP-UMNO relations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The PAP was led by Lee Kuan Yew and had non-communal policies and equality for all races and religions</li>
        <li>The UMNO was led by Tunku Abdul Rahman and wanted special rights for indigenous Malays as a form of affirmative action</li>
        <li>These ideological differences resulted in a "cold peace" between the parties where the PAP would stay in Singapore only and avoid Peninsular politics</li>
        <li>Relations worsened when the PAP won 37/51 seats in the 1963 elections over the Singapore UMNO and Singapore Alliance Party (UMNO supported)</li>
        <li>In the 1964, the PAP went further and entered Peninsular politics, winning a seat in Selangor</li>
        <li>This led to the UMNO escalating their anti-PAP propaganda in the media, setting the stage for the 1964 Race Riots</li>
    </ul>
