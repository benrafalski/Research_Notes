    <h2>Secession of Singapore</h2>
    <h3>1964 Race Riots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Initially, Tunku rejected Lee Kuan Yew's proposal to join the Federation of Malaysia due to the large population of Chinese in Singpore</li>
        <li>However, Tunku changed his mind when Singpore leader Ong Eng Guan (anti-communist who had been expelled from the PAP) won by election as an independent</li>
        <li>July 1964 Riot: Occured during the celebration of Mawlid (Muhammad birthday) of 25,000 Muslim Malay people when clashes broke out between the Malays and the Chinese and eventually spread to mass rioting (4 deaths, 178 injured, 20 Chinese shops burnt down)</li>
        <li>September 1964 Riot: Broke out due to heighted tensions following July when a Malay was murdered sparking stabbings and violence (13 killed, 106 injured, 1439 arrested)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PAP-UMNO relations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The PAP was led by Lee Kuan Yew and had non-communal policies and equality for all races and religions</li>
        <li>The UMNO was led by Tunku Abdul Rahman and wanted special rights for indigenous Malays as a form of affirmative action</li>
        <li>These ideological differences resulted in a "cold peace" between the parties where the PAP would stay in Singapore only and avoid Peninsular politics</li>
        <li>Relations worsened when the PAP won 37/51 seats in the 1963 elections over the Singapore UMNO and Singapore Alliance Party (UMNO supported)</li>
        <li>In the 1964, the PAP went further and entered Peninsular politics, winning a seat in Selangor</li>
        <li>This led to the UMNO escalating their anti-PAP propaganda in the media (including anti-PAP leaflets saying rumoring Chinese in Singpore would try and kill the Malays), setting the stage for the July 1964 Race Riot</li>
    </ul>
