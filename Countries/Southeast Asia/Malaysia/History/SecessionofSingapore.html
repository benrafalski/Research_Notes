    <h2>Secession of Singapore</h2>
    <h3>1964 Race Riots</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Initially, Tunku rejected Lee Kuan Yew's proposal to join the Federation of Malaysia due to the large population of Chinese in Singpore</li>
        <li>However, Tunku changed his mind when Singpore leader Ong Eng Guan (anti-communist who had been expelled from the PAP) won by election as an independent</li>
        <li>July 1964 Riot: Occured during the celebration of Mawlid (Muhammad birthday) of 25,000 Muslim Malay people when clashes broke out between the Malays and the Chinese and eventually spread to mass rioting (4 deaths, 178 injured, 20 Chinese shops burnt down)</li>
        <li>September 1964 Riot: Broke out due to heighted tensions following July when a Malay was murdered sparking stabbings and violence (13 killed, 106 injured, 1439 arrested)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PAP-UMNO relations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The PAP was led by Lee Kuan Yew and had non-communal policies and equality for all races and religions</li>
        <li>The UMNO was led by Tunku Abdul Rahman and wanted special rights for indigenous Malays as a form of affirmative action</li>
        <li>These ideological differences resulted in a "cold peace" between the parties where the PAP would stay in Singapore only and avoid Peninsular politics</li>
        <li>In 1960, the two began negotiating for a merger after Malayan independence because the UMNO feared the communist insurgency could spread to Singapore and the PAP wanted independence from the British</li>
        <li>In April 1961, Yew proposed the idea of the Federation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>Following the creation of Malaysia, the MCA influenced the UMNO against the PAP in fear that the PAP would replace them (the MCA feared)</li>
        <li>Relations worsened after Malaysian independence when the PAP won 37/51 seats in the 1963 elections over the Singapore UMNO and Singapore Alliance Party (UMNO supported)</li>
        <li>In the 1964, the PAP went further and entered Peninsular politics, winning a seat in Selangor</li>
        <li>This led to the UMNO escalating their anti-PAP propaganda in the media (including anti-PAP leaflets saying rumoring Chinese in Singpore would try and kill the Malays), setting the stage for the July 1964 Race Riot</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>MacDonald House Bombing</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Between 1936-1966, the Indonesian attempted 37 bombings accross Malaysia and Singapore during Konfrontasi because of their opposition to the formation of Malaysia since they saw it as a neo-colonial British state</li>
        <li>As a result, a volunteer police force was set up in Singapore in 1964</li>
        <li>However, 29 bombs still were set off before March 1965</li>
        <li>On March 10 1965, the MacDonald House in Orchard Road, Singapore was bombed by the Indonesians in a sabotage attack (killed 3, injured 33)</li>
        <li>Two of the Indonesian bombers were later captured and found guilty of murder and were hanged in 1968</li>
        <li>After Suharto took over in Indonesia he plead to reestablish relations with Singapore but was rejected</li>
        <li>After the hanging in 1968, the Singapore embassy in Indonesia was destroyed and relations remained tense until 1973 when relations began to improve</li>
        <li>In 2014, Indoensia names a warship after the Indonesian bombers of the MacDonald house, this led to a controversy and worsening of relations</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Separation of Singapore</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>On August 7, 1965, Tunku announced that Parliament should vote yes to have Singapore expelled from the Federation</li>
        <li>On August 9, 1965, the Government of Malaysia and Singapore agreed to separate with the Proclomation of Singapore (act to amend the Malaysian Constitution)</li>
        <li>This made Singapore an independent and democratic state</li>
        <li>Singapore said they withdrew from the Federation on their own accord, however, the PAP had no say in the matter</li>
        <li>The PAP even had pressured Tunku not to expell them</li>
        <li>After separation, the two kept friendly relations, trade agreements, and defense ties. All federal ties were severed. </li>
    </ul>
