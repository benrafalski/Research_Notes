    <h2>Batang Kali Massacre</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Killing during the Malayan Emergency</li>
        <li>On Dec 12 1948, the Scots Guards killed 24 unarmed men in Batang Kali (northeastern Selangor) and then burned down the village</li>
        <li>Notable for being the only massacre by the British during the war</li>
        <li>After 1950, there were several British government investigations, however none of them have resulted in charges due to insufficient evidence to convict</li>
        <li>In 1970, the British newspaper, the People, published testemonies from members of the platoon that the massacre happened</li>
        <li>In 1990, UK officials pressured Malaysian authorities into halting a police inquiry into the massacre</li>
        <li>The British position is that the villagers were killed as they tried to escape into the jungle, after being warned they would be shot if they tried</li>
        <li>Members of the Scots Guard have claimed their was no escape attempt and they were ordered to carry out the massacre</li>
    </ul>
