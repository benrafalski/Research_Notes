    <h2>Sarawak ceded to Britain</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After the Japanese occupation, Sarawak was devestated by war</li>
        <li>After the Japanese occupation ended, Sarawak was eventually handed bck to Raja Vyneer Brooke</li>
        <li>On July 1, 1946, Vyner terminated Brooke rule</li>
        <li>He ceded Sarawak to Great Britain and made it a crown colony</li>
        <li>This was proceeded by a bitter family feud and the native Sarawak population was not very happy with the deal and sparked an anti-cession movement</li>
        <li>Many Malays also opposed the end of the Brooke Raja, resulting in political tensions for years to come</li>
        <li>Groups for cessesion: Chinese, Iban, Indian</li>
        <li>Groups against cessesion: Malay (Malay youth Association and Malay National Association)</li>
        <li>In 1947, an extremist nationalist group called Rukun 13 was formed with Rosli Dhobi as its leader</li>
        <li>In December 1949, Rosli Dhobi stabbed the second governor of Sarawak, Duncan Stewart.</li>
        <li>Rosli was hanged and the Rukun was outlawed following this, all other anti-cessation movements were also banned</li>
        <li>By February 1951, the anti-cessation movement was ended</li>
        <li>The anti-cessation movement is seen as the beginning of Sarawak Malay nationalism and the fight for Sarawak independence</li>
