    <h2>Malayan Emergency</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Malayan emergency was a 12 year period of unrest following the creation of the Federation of Malaya</li>
        <li>The federation was formed to give Malaya independence while also keeping their natural resources (rubber/tin) in the British sphere to pay back the US after WWII</li>
        <li>In 1930, the Malayan Communinst Party was formed</li>
        <li>They were led by Chin Peng and contained mostly Chinese who wanted an independent communist Malaya</li>
        <li>In June 1948, the government declared a state of emergency after 3 European plantation managers were murdered by communists in Perak (Sungai Siput incident)</li>
        <li>The British responded with mass arrests and killings of suspected communists</li>
        <li>After the Sungai Siput incident, in February 1948, the MCP formed the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), a guerrilla army which was effectively the successor to the MPAJA</li>
        <li>At its peak the MNLA had about 8,000 members and got no foreign support or training</li>
        <li>The MNLA fled into the jungles and began a guerrilla insurgency against the colonial government, mainly targeting their plantations/economic infrustructure</li>
        <li>The majority of the Chinese did not back the communists, although this is where the MNLA got most of their support</li>
        <li>The civilian branch of the MNLA was known as the Min Yuen</li>
        <li>The British finally responed with the Briggs Plan in April 1950: military suppression and forcibly moved many rural Chinese into strategically controlled "New Villages" to cut off food for the guerrillas</li>
        <li>The New Villages where effectively concentration camps and resulted in 400,000-1,000,000 civilians being displaced</li>
        <li>This successfully isolated villagers from guerrillas but resulted in increased government unpopularity</li>
        <li>Under High commissioner Sir Gerald Templer, the British finally started to ease some of the social/political tensions</li>
        <li>Agent orange used by Templer: first herbicide used as a military weapon to cut off the food supply from the communists </li>
        <li>Templer implemented local elections and the creation of village councils, facilitating independence</li>
        <li>He also gave many Chinese citizenship</li>
        <li>These measures decreased the support for the insurgency in the mid-1950s</li>
        <li>In 1955, the government released an amnesty delcaration saying any MNLA member that surrenders will not be prosecuted or punished if they vow loyal to the federation and give up communism</li>
        <li>However, few communists chose to surrender</li>
        <li>Baling talks: later in 1955, Chin Peng finally agreed to meet with the British but the talks were futile</li>
        <li>In February 1956, the British even withdrew their anmesty declaration</li>
        <li>Over the next three years the MNLA would fall into decline</li>
        <li>By July 1960, the emergency was officially declared over</li>
        <li>Casualties: 6,710 MNLA killed, 1,346 Malayan troops/police killed, 1,443 British forces killed, 2,478 civilians killed with 810 missing </li>
        <li>War crimes: alleged toruture by the British on villagers who were suspected of aiding the MNLA, Batang Kali Massacre, New Village internment camps for about 500,000 people, other instances of collective punishment, over 30,000 deportations, Ibans headhunted the MNLA with British support,  </li>
    </ul>
