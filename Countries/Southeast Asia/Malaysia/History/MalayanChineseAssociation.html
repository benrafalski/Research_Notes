    <h2>Malayan Chinese Association</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In February 1949, the MCA was formed with the support of the British government</li>
        <li>The MCA was founded in order to represent the Malaysian Chinese</li>
        <li>The British wanted them to help manage the Chinese living in New Villages during the emergency</li>
        <li>In 1951, the MCA was officially named a political party</li>
        <li>Their first president was prominent Chiniese businessman Tan Cheng Lock</li>
        <li>Their early supporters were mostly wealthy Chinese and they got little support from the New Villages</li>
        <li>In 1955, the MCA was part of the Alliance Party</li>
        <li>The 1955 elections resulted in the Alliance Party winning 51/52 seats</li>
        <li>The MCA was dominant in elections until 1969 when they began to be challenged by the Democratic Action Party and Gerakan</li>
        <li>In the 1969 elections, tensions between these parties rose so much they led to the May 13 Riots to break out</li>
        <li>The 1969 elections resulted in a major loss for the MCA and severely decreased their status in the Alliance</li>
        <li>In the 1995 election, Ling Liong Sik led the MCA to win 30/34 seats and 71/77 state seats</li>
        <li>This success was also carried over in the 1999 elections and reestablished the MCA in the BN (former Alliance) coalition</li>
        <li>Into the early 2000s, the party would be split among so called "Team A" and "Team B" </li>
        <li>Team A was to be led by Ling's successor, Ong Ka Ting, and Team B was led by Chan Kong Choy</li>
        <li>In 2004, the MCA united under Ong and Chan and won strongly with 31/40 seats and 76/90 state seats</li>
        <li>However, in the 2008 elections, the MCA fared badly winning nly 15/32 seats, resulting in Ong leaving as president and being replaced by Ong Tee Keat</li>
        <li>Over the later 2010s, the perty began to deteriorate and lose more support due to increase factionalism</li>
        <li>By 2018, they only retained one seat in parliament and has remained a low status party ever since</li>
