    <h2>Formation of Malaysia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In November 1961, the Malaysia Agreement was drafted that would give North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In January 1962, the Cobbold Commission, led by Lord Cobbold, was set up to determine of Sabah and Sarawak wanted to join the Federation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In August 1961, the Cobbold commision stated they recommended that Malaysia become a state due to their findings</li>
