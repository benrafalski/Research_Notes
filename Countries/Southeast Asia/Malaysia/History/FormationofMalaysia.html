    <h2>Formation of Malaysia</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In November 1961, the Malaysia Agreement was drafted that would give North Borneo, Sarawak, and Singapore to form the Federation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In January 1962, the Cobbold Commission, led by Lord Cobbold, was set up to determine of Sabah and Sarawak wanted to join the Federation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In August 1961, the Cobbold commision stated they recommended that Malaysia become a state due to their findings</li>
        <li>Findings: 1/3 of the population of each territory strongly supported the formation of Malaysia, 1/3 supported it as long as their rights were protected, 1/6 wanted independence then Malaysia, and 1/6 wanted British rule</li>
        <li>In July 1963, the Malaysia Act was passed in the UK parliament forming the Federation of Malaysia with North Borneo (renamed Sabah), Sarawak, Singapore, and Malaya</li>
        <li>Brunei had also been invited to join but they wanted to remain a British protectorate and later gained their own independence</li>
        <li>Tunku Abdul Rahman continued as both prime minister and foreign minsiter of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In September 1963, the Proclamation of Malaysia declared the official merger of the terrritories and the Federation of Malaysia went into affect</li>
        <li>The British wanted the Malaysia to be formed to give North Borneo, Singapore, and Sarawak independence, so that they wouldn't have to worry about them anymore since they had become too burdensome</li>
        <li>This was despite the fact that each of these territories were ethnically and historically different from each other</li>
        <li>Tunku was also welcome to the fact that the Borneo states were non-Chinese, which would increase the Malaya majority politically</li>
        <li>Sabah and Sarawak chose to join the Federation hurriedly, many of the Borneo residents resented their loss of autonomy (especially petroleum revenues)</li>
