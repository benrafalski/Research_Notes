    <h2>Plantation-based Economies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The British eventually took over administration, with the sultans as symbolic rulers, of Malaysia and achieved peace and security</li>
        <li>In the 1820s, tin mining started in Perak and Selangor and attracted many Chinese immigrants</li>
        <li>In 1877, rubber tree cultivation started in Singapore</li>
        <li>By 1883, Malaysia was the world's largest tin producer</li>
        <li>In the 1890s there was a huge surge in demand for rubber.</li>
        <li>In 1912, the French introduced commercial oil palm estates in Selangor</li>
        <li>By the 1930s, Malaysia produced half of the world's rubber.</li>
        <li>Malaysian plantations mainly had Indian and Chinese laborers, imported by the British owners because they wanted the rural Malay farmers to be protected from economic and cultrual changes that would disrupt traditional class divisions</li>
        <li>The British utilized this "divide and conquer" strategy to maintain their control over Malaysia.</li>
        <li>The rise of plantations during the industrialization period of the West drove economic growth, transforming Malaysia into Britain's richest colony</li>
    </ul>
