    <h2>ASEAN Founded</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1961, the Phillipines, Thailand, and the Federation of Malaya formed ASA (Association of South East Asia)</li>
        <li>In July 1963, Malaysia, the Phillipines, and Indonesia proposed the formation of Maphilindo, a nonpolitical confederation that eventually failed due to the perception that it was formed to prevent the formation of Malaysia and after Sukarno started Konfrontasi</li>
        <li>In August 1967, to replace ASA, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Phillipines, Singapore, and Thailand formed a new organization called ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) with the signing of the Bangkok Declaration</li>
        <li>The formation of ASEAN caused relations between Indonesia, Malaysia, the Phillipines, and Singapore to strengthen after the seccession of Singapore, the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation, and Phillipines withdrawing diplomatic ties following the formation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>One theory for the formation of ASEAN was to contain communism and act as a front against communist Vietnam</li>
        <li>This was an international orgaization to accelerate economic growth, social progress, and cultural development and security in Southeast Asia</li>
        <li>Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia would also later join</li>
        <li>Experts believe that ASEAN has been a large factor in the prevention of hostilities between Southeast Asian states</li>
    </ul>
