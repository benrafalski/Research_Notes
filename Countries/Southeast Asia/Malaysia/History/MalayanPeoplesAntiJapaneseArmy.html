    <h2>Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After the invasion in December 1941, the MPAJA was formed</li>
        <li>They were mostly ethnic Chinese guerrillas and pro-communist</li>
        <li>The group was formed as a combined force of the Malayan Communist Party, British colonial government, and other smaller anti-Japanese groups</li>
        <li>The MCP was seen as the leader of the group and Great Britain supplied them with officers and resources</li>
        <li>The MPAJA never saw success against the Japanese however and the occupation continued until the end of the war</li>
        <li>There was also a brief Chinese-led revolt in North Boreo during WWII against the Japanese too</li>
        <li>The occupation led to increased tension between the Malayas and Chinese due to the selective treatment the Japanese engaged in, treating the Chinese worse</li>
        <li>Furthermore, the occpation undermined the British authority in the region</li>
        <li>The Brookes and the North Borneo company would be permanently undermined and anti-British sentiment among the Malay and Chinese in the peninsula would begin to rise</li>
    </ul>
