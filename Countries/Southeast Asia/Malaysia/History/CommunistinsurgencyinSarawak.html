    <h2>Communist insurgency in Sarawak</h2>
    <h3>Brunei Revolt</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>During the Japanese occupation of Sarawak, the Sarawak Anti-Fascist League was formed as a Communist movement against the Japanese</li>
        <li>By 1956, the Sarawak Advanced Youths' Association was formed, absorbing many communist organizations in the area</li>
        <li>In 1971, the North Kalimantan Communist Party (NKCP) was founded in Indonesia</li>
        <li>All of these organizations were predominately Chinese and received little support from the Malays</li>
        <li>The Sarawak Communist Organization (SCO) were anti-British colonialism and also against the formation of the Federation of Malaysia in 1963</li>
        <li>In December 1962, the Sarawak insurgency broke out following the beginning of the Brunei Revolt</li>
        <li>The Brunei Revolt was a failed coup against the Malaysian Federation by the North Kalimantan National Army, who wanted a state with Brunei, Sarawak, and North Borneo only</li>
        <li>Following the Brunei Revolt, the SCO started a policy of armed insurgency in January 1963 and the British responded with anti-communist crackdowns</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Malaysia-Indonesia Confrontation</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>During Konfrontasi, the SCO would fight with the Indonesians against the Malaysian/Commonwealth forces</li>
        <li>The SCO used Indonesian Kalimantan as a base during the conflict and form the new North Kalamantan Communist Party guerrilla forces</li>
        <li>The Indonesians themselves formed hte North Kalimantan People's Army with the help of the PKI in October 1965</li>
        <li>In October 1965, General Suharto couped Sukarno in Indonesia and launched a purge on commnist elements in Indonesia</li>
        <li>The Indonesian army would then begin to work with the Malaysian army to fight against the SCO insurgents, this was accompanied by a Dayak-led pogrom on the ethnic Indonesian Chinese in West Kalimantan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Goodsir Plan</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In June 1965, the Sarawak and Malaysian Federal government impmeneted this plan as counter-insurgency</li>
        <li>The plan resettled 7,500 people into 5 temporary settlements on the Kuching-Serian road in Sarawak</li>
        <li>The villages were protected by barbed wire and resembed New Villages used during the Malayan Emergency</li>
        <li>The Goodsir Plan succeeded (like New Villages), in cutting off the supply of food and supplies to the SCO from their Chinese supporters</li>
        <li>By the end of 1965, there were three permanent settlements built to house 8,000 villagers</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In Febrary 1969, Tunku met with the SUPP from Sarawak in which the SUPP agreed to reverse their anti-Malaysian policy</li>
        <li>In July 1970, the SUPP joined the Alliance Party, enabling the Malaysian Federal government to consolidate power over Sarawak</li>
        <li>In March 1969, the communists were defeated in West Kalimantan and by July, a new North Kalimantan Peoples Guerrilla Force had emerged in their place after being formed by the SCO</li>
        <li>The North Kalimantan Communist Party formed in 1970 fro the Sarawak Peoples Guerillas</li>
        <li>In 1973-74, 75% of the NKCP agreed to surrender to the Malaysian government and in March 1974 the Sarawak governemnt and the communists signed the Sri Aman peace treaty</li>
        <li>However, within a year about 100 communists returned to the jungle to continue the armed struggle</li>
        <li>In 1989, the MCP and the Malaysian government signed the Hat Yai peace accords and the NKCP agreed to end their insurgency</li>
        <li>In October 1990, the insurgency formally ended with the Wisma Bapa peace agreement</li>
