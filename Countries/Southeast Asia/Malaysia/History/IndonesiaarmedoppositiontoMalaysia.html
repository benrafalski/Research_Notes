    <h2>Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation (Konfrontasi)</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>After the creation of the state of Malaysia from the Federation of Malaya, Indonesia reacted with armed conflict due to their opposition to the Federation</li>
        <li>Labuan was the headquarters for the Commonwealth (British associaiton) defense forces</li>
        <li>Fighting occured between Indonesian, Malaysian, and Commonwealth forces (UK, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand), mostly along the land border in Borneo that East Malaysia and Indonesia shared</li>
        <li>Indonesia was supported by China, Phillipines, the USSR, North Vietnam, and the Malayan Communist Party</li>
        <li>Malaysia was supported by the US and Canada</li>
        <li>Communist Chinese Sarawak insurgents also fought alongside the Indonesians due to their anti-cecession roots</li>
        <li>Causualties: 114 soldiers killed and 36 civilians kiled (Malaysia side), 590 killed (Indonesian side)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Start of Conflict</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In January 1963, Indonesia announced they would pursue a policy of Konfrontasi (non-compliance) with the British Malaysia proposal</li>
        <li>The Indonesian president, Sukarno, thought Malaysia was a British puppet state and had also previously takes West New Guinea from the Dutch and looked to Malaysia next</li>
        <li>At the Manila meeting, Indonesia agreed (along with the Phillipines) to let Malaysia form if most of the Sarawak and North Borneo residents wanted it</li>
        <li>However, in September 1953, the Cobbold Commission found that most of the residents were in favor of joining Malaysia, Indonesia and the Phillipines rejected the results</li>
        <li>Riots also broke out at the Malaysian and Singapore embassies in Indonesia</li>
        <li>In April 1963, a police station was attacked by Indonesia forces for the start of the conflict</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Operation Claret</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In September 1963, Malaysia was officially formed and their troops entered the fighting</li>
        <li>During this time peace negotiations began in Thailand and Japan, as well as direct secret talks started by Indonesian general Ahmad Yani due to worsening domestic conditions</li>
        <li>By May 1964, Sukarno called for revolutions in Malays, Singapore, Sarawak, and Sabah and in August Indonesia expanded the air and sea battles to the Malaysian Peninsula</li>
        <li>In June 1964, the British Commonwealth forces began secret cross-border raids, approved to a depth of 5,000 yards and later 10,000 yards and later 20,000 yards, mounted from Sabah and Sarawak by special forces known as Operation Claret</li>
        <li>The majority of the raids were undertaken by the British Gurkha battalions but also Australian and New Zealand forces</li>
        <li>The raids were highly classified due to risk of escalation and allowing Indonesia to use the "imperialist aggression" narrative and largely successful in placing the Indonesians on the defensive rather than letting them mount attacks from Kalimantan until they were suspended in July 1966</li>
        <li>The UK didn't ackowladge their involvement in Claret until 1974 and New Zealand until 1996</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conflict Resolution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In February 1965, Indonesia was abandoned by the Phillipines, who announced their normalization of relations with Kuala Lumpur</li>
        <li>Sukarno reacted in disappral and pledged to fight on with the conflict alone</li>
        <li>In September 1965, there was an attempted coup in Jakarta (Indonesian capitol) by the Indonesian Communist Party</li>
        <li>Following this, Indonesia's attacks finally began to ease do to the growing domestic issues</li>
        <li>Eventually, the events led to Sukarno being exluded from the newly formed government of March 1967, where a new leader, Suharto, consalidated his power over Indonesia</li>
        <li>In May 1966, at the confrence of Bangkok, the Malaysian and Indonesian governments declared an end to the conflict</li>
        <li>The peace agreement was finally ratified in August 1966</li>
    </ul>
