    <h2>North Borneo Dispute</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1878, the Sultanate of Sulu (Phillipines) and the British North Borneo Company signed the 1878 Agreement where the BNBC would pay yearly payments of 5300 ringgit to the sultan for East Sabah in exchange for east Sabah</li>
        <li>The original text was written in Jawi and it is disputed if the agreement said that East Sabah was leased or sold to the BNBC</li>
        <li>In 1885, the UK, Germany, and Spain had the signed the Madrid Protocol where Spain would gain full control over the Phillipines and Spain would relenquish all claims by the sultanate to North Borneo to the UK</li>
        <li>In 1903, the Sultan Jamalul Kiram II signed the Comfirmation of cessesion of certain islands, that ceded some of the Eastern Sabah islands to the BNBC</li>
        <li>In 1939, Chief Justice Charles Frederick Cunningham Macaskie of the High Court of North Borneo ruled on who would be payed the cession money after Jamalul Kiram II died while childless</li>
        <li>Proponents point to this ruling as proof that East Sabah belonged to the Sultan at this point</li>
        <li>In 1961, North Borneo signed the Malaysia Agreement that would make Sabah a part of the Federation of Malaysia</li>
        <li>However, the Phillipines rejected this and disputed that East Sabah as their own land</li>
        <li>In July 1963, the Phillipine, Malayan, and Indonesian governments met to sign the Manila Accord where Tunku Abdul Rahman agreed to pay the Phillipines what the Malays call "cessision payments" and what the Phillipines call "rent" for East Sabah</li>
        <li>Also included in the Manila Accord, was that Indonesia and the Phillipines would recognize the formation of Malaysia with East Sabah if the Sabah population wanted it</li>
        <li>In the following months, a UN commission found that a "a sizeable majority of the people" wanted independence, the Phillipines and Indonesia rejected the findings</li>
    </ul>
