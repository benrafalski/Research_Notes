    <ul>

    <h3>Pedra Branca Dispute</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedra_Branca_dispute -->
        <li>Islands include: Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge</li>
        <li>In 1850-51, Pedra Branca began being administered by Singapore after the UK built the Horsburgh Lighthouse on it</li>
        <li>The island was previously administered by the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor until it became part of the Straits Settlements in 1826</li>
        <li>In 1979, Malaysia published a map proclaiming the islands were theirs</li>
        <li>In 1980, Singapore diplomatically protested the map, claiming Pedra Blanca</li>
        <li>In 1993, Singpore claimed the islands of Middle Rocks and South Ledge</li>
        <li>In 1989, Singapore proposed a dispute in the ICJ and Malaysia agreed in 1994</li>
        <li>The ICJ case began in 2007 and Singapore argued that Pedra Branca (Singapore said all the islands were one entity) was <i>terra nullius</i> ("land belonging to no one") and that there is not evidence the islands ever belonged to the Johor Sultanate but rather the UK for the construction of the lighthouse in 1847</li>
        <li>Malaysia's case was that that Johor had the original title to Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, that the islands were not a single entity, and that the British just built the lighthouse but sovereignty over the islands stayed with Johor.</li>
        <li>A controversy with the case was that Malaysia's main evidence was a letter they said the Johor Temanggung recieved from Britain asking for permission to build the lighhouse but left sovereignty over the island with Johor, however Malaysia claimed the letter was in Singapore's archives, which Singapore denied.</li>
        <li>Largely resolved by the ICJ in 2008 after they ruled Pedra Branca was Singapore's (12-4), Middle Rock was Malaysia's (15-1), and South Ledge was both since it was in overlapping waters (15-1).</li>
        <li>The ICJ ruling largely pleased both sides and the Joint Technical Committee was established in 2008 to delimit boundary areas adn determine ownership of South Ledge..</li>

    <h3>Islamic Movement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Islam was introduced in the Malay Peninsula in 1100's CE and was the majority faith by the 1400-1500s with the rise of the Sultan</li>
        <li>Following WW2, the first Islamic political movements began to form with the Malay Nationalist Party (MNP) but was dissolved during the Malay Emergency</li>
        <li>In 1951, this movement would reform into the Pan Malayan Islamic Party (PAS) as a splinter group of the UMNO</li>
        <li>When Malaysia was formed, Sunni Islam was named the country's religion due to recommendations to do so from the Reid Commission, other religions remained legal constitutionally but freedom of religion is still limited (including a complete ban on Shia Islam)</li>
        <li>The constitution stated that you must be Muslim to be an ethnic Malay</li>
        <li>In 1972, the PAS president Asri Muda announced that the party would be joining the Alliance Party (UMNO-PAS partnership)</li>
        <li>PAS was most popular in the rural states such of Kelantan, Terengganu, Perlis, and Kedah</li>
        <li>In the 1974 general election, PAS got their most parliament seats (14) but Asri left BN (Alliance Party) in 1977, severely damaging PAS popularity (only 5 seats in 1978 election)</li>
        <li>In the late 1970s, the dakwah or Islamic fundumentalist revival grew among the younger generation who disliked the westernization of Malay society</li>
        <li>In 1977, during the Kelantan Emergency, the Islamic BERJASA political party was formed as a splinter group of the PAS </li>
        <li>In the 1978 election, BERJASA joined BN and won 11 state seats in Kelantan (UMNO got 23, PAS got 2) but their popularity quickly dissolved in subsequent elections</li>
        <li>Before the Islamic revival, many Malay Muslims only followed moderate Islam but after the revival, Malaysia transformed into a more Islamic enviornment</li>
        <li>Today, almost all ethnic Malays are Muslim and about 70% of Malay Muslim women wear headscarves (which popularized during the 1980s)</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Spratly Island dispute</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spratly_Islands_dispute -->
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea -->
        <li>The Spratly islands are a small group of islands in the South China sea with maritime features (cays, reefs, banks), oil reserves, and commercial fishing grounds.</li>
        <li>China, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam claim the whole spratly islands, while Brunei and Malaysia claim part of the islands.</li>
        <li>Malaysia's claims to some of the islands are only ones that are in its exclusive economic zone (exclusive rights over a territory) of 200 miles as defined by the UN Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that was signed in 1982</li>
        <li>This claim requires that the islands are <i>res nullius</i> (land belongs to nobody), which was satisfied when Japan renounced the islands after the end of WW2 with the signing of the San Francisco Treaty</li>
        <li>Malaysia militarily occupies the 5 islands it considers as part of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In 1971, Malaysian issued their first claims over some of the Spratly Islands</li>
        <li>In 1979, Malaysia published a map of their continental shelf (the Pedra Branca one) that included 12 of the Spratly islands</li>
        <li>Swallow Reef became Malaysian military occupied in 1983 and has been turned into an island through land reclamation.</li>
        <li>Malaysia also military occupies Ardasier Reef and Mariveles Reef</li>
        <li>In 1992, Malaysia and Vietnam jointly agreed to develop areas around these disputed islands</li>
        <li>In 1994, Malaysia agreed to sign the UNCLOS</li>
        <li>In 2009, the UNCLOS allowed for extended limits beyond 200 miles and Vietman and Malaysia made a new joint claim over a "defined area" in the middle of the South China Sea between the two countries and that included part of the Spratly Islands</li>
        <li>In 2010, it was reported that Mahathir Mohamad believed he could profit from economic growth with China and that they were not a threat to the region</li>
        <li>Malaysia has since shifted to actively condemning China as they encroach into its territorial waters.</li>
        <li>In 2011, China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Phillipines, Taiwan, and Vietnam agreed to a set of guidelines called the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) to help resolve maritime disputes.</li>
        <li>Indonesia is not part of the SCS dispute but between 2014-2019 had destroyed 87 Malaysian ships (out of 556 total) for violating their rules</li>
