        <li>After the May 13 riots, Kuala Lumpur was subject to clashes between the federal government (Alliance majority) and the Selangor state government (opposition majority)</li>
        <li>In February 1974, Kuala Lumpur was split off from Selangor and made a federal territory to solve the issue</li>
        <li>The change made it so that Kuala Lumpur residents could no longer vote in Selangor state elections and only federal parliamentary elections</li>
        <li>In April 1984, Labuan became the second federal territory as it was chosen to be an offshore financial center by the federal government</li>

    <h3>Kelantan Emergency</h3>
    <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1977_Kelantan_Emergency -->
    <ul>
        <li>In 1977, the Chief Minister of Kelantan was Mohamed Nasir of the PAS</li>

        <li>The next day the  Emergency Powers (Kelantan) Act 1977 was passed to give Parliament power to govern the state</li>
        <li>12/14 BN PAS members voted against the bill and the PAS was expelled from the BN as a result</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Pedra Branca Dispute</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedra_Branca_dispute -->
        <li>Islands include: Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks, and South Ledge</li>
        <li>In 1850-51, Pedra Branca began being administered by Singapore after the UK built the Horsburgh Lighthouse on it</li>
        <li>The island was previously administered by the Sultan and Temenggung of Johor until it became part of the Straits Settlements in 1826</li>
        <li>In 1979, Malaysia published a map proclaiming the islands were theirs</li>
        <li>In 1980, Singapore diplomatically protested the map, claiming Pedra Blanca</li>
        <li>In 1993, Singpore claimed the islands of Middle Rocks and South Ledge</li>
        <li>In 1989, Singapore proposed a dispute in the ICJ and Malaysia agreed in 1994</li>
        <li>The ICJ case began in 2007 and Singapore argued that Pedra Branca (Singapore said all the islands were one entity) was <i>terra nullius</i> ("land belonging to no one") and that there is not evidence the islands ever belonged to the Johor Sultanate but rather the UK for the construction of the lighthouse in 1847</li>
        <li>Malaysia's case was that that Johor had the original title to Pedra Branca, Middle Rocks and South Ledge, that the islands were not a single entity, and that the British just built the lighthouse but sovereignty over the islands stayed with Johor.</li>
        <li>A controversy with the case was that Malaysia's main evidence was a letter they said the Johor Temanggung recieved from Britain asking for permission to build the lighhouse but left sovereignty over the island with Johor, however Malaysia claimed the letter was in Singapore's archives, which Singapore denied.</li>
        <li>Largely resolved by the ICJ in 2008 after they ruled Pedra Branca was Singapore's (12-4), Middle Rock was Malaysia's (15-1), and South Ledge was both since it was in overlapping waters (15-1).</li>
        <li>The ICJ ruling largely pleased both sides and the Joint Technical Committee was established in 2008 to delimit boundary areas adn determine ownership of South Ledge..</li>

    <h3>Islamic Movement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Islam was introduced in the Malay Peninsula in 1100's CE and was the majority faith by the 1400-1500s with the rise of the Sultan</li>
        <li>Following WW2, the first Islamic political movements began to form with the Malay Nationalist Party (MNP) but was dissolved during the Malay Emergency</li>
        <li>In 1951, this movement would reform into the Pan Malayan Islamic Party (PAS) as a splinter group of the UMNO</li>
        <li>When Malaysia was formed, Sunni Islam was named the country's religion due to recommendations to do so from the Reid Commission, other religions remained legal constitutionally but freedom of religion is still limited (including a complete ban on Shia Islam)</li>
        <li>The constitution stated that you must be Muslim to be an ethnic Malay</li>
        <li>In 1972, the PAS president Asri Muda announced that the party would be joining the Alliance Party (UMNO-PAS partnership)</li>
        <li>PAS was most popular in the rural states such of Kelantan, Terengganu, Perlis, and Kedah</li>
        <li>In the 1974 general election, PAS got their most parliament seats (14) but Asri left BN (Alliance Party) in 1977, severely damaging PAS popularity (only 5 seats in 1978 election)</li>
        <li>In the late 1970s, the dakwah or Islamic fundumentalist revival grew among the younger generation who disliked the westernization of Malay society</li>
        <li>In 1977, during the Kelantan Emergency, the Islamic BERJASA political party was formed as a splinter group of the PAS </li>
        <li>In the 1978 election, BERJASA joined BN and won 11 state seats in Kelantan (UMNO got 23, PAS got 2) but their popularity quickly dissolved in subsequent elections</li>
        <li>Before the Islamic revival, many Malay Muslims only followed moderate Islam but after the revival, Malaysia transformed into a more Islamic enviornment</li>
        <li>Today, almost all ethnic Malays are Muslim and about 70% of Malay Muslim women wear headscarves (which popularized during the 1980s)</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Spratly Island dispute</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spratly_Islands_dispute -->
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea -->
        <li>The Spratly islands are a small group of islands in the South China sea with maritime features (cays, reefs, banks), oil reserves, and commercial fishing grounds.</li>
        <li>China, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam claim the whole spratly islands, while Brunei and Malaysia claim part of the islands.</li>
        <li>Malaysia's claims to some of the islands are only ones that are in its exclusive economic zone (exclusive rights over a territory) of 200 miles as defined by the UN Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) that was signed in 1982</li>
        <li>This claim requires that the islands are <i>res nullius</i> (land belongs to nobody), which was satisfied when Japan renounced the islands after the end of WW2 with the signing of the San Francisco Treaty</li>
        <li>Malaysia militarily occupies the 5 islands it considers as part of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In 1971, Malaysian issued their first claims over some of the Spratly Islands</li>
        <li>In 1979, Malaysia published a map of their continental shelf (the Pedra Branca one) that included 12 of the Spratly islands</li>
        <li>Swallow Reef became Malaysian military occupied in 1983 and has been turned into an island through land reclamation.</li>
        <li>Malaysia also military occupies Ardasier Reef and Mariveles Reef</li>
        <li>In 1992, Malaysia and Vietnam jointly agreed to develop areas around these disputed islands</li>
        <li>In 1994, Malaysia agreed to sign the UNCLOS</li>
        <li>In 2009, the UNCLOS allowed for extended limits beyond 200 miles and Vietman and Malaysia made a new joint claim over a "defined area" in the middle of the South China Sea between the two countries and that included part of the Spratly Islands</li>
        <li>In 2010, it was reported that Mahathir Mohamad believed he could profit from economic growth with China and that they were not a threat to the region</li>
        <li>Malaysia has since shifted to actively condemning China as they encroach into its territorial waters.</li>
        <li>In 2011, China, Brunei, Malaysia, the Phillipines, Taiwan, and Vietnam agreed to a set of guidelines called the Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea (DOC) to help resolve maritime disputes.</li>
        <li>Indonesia is not part of the SCS dispute but between 2014-2019 had destroyed 87 Malaysian ships (out of 556 total) for violating their rules</li>

        <li>In 1981, the president of the PAS, Hadi Awang, claimed that the UMNO was unIslamic because they were colonialist and said any struggle against the UNMO is therefore jihad and that anyone who died in a struggle was al-Shahid (martyrs)</li>

    <h3>Operation Lalang (October 1987)</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Lalang -->
        <!-- https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/Malaysia-from-independence-to-c-2000 -->
        <li>Code name: Operation Laling (Operation Weeding)</li>
        <li>In 1986 and 1987, a split occured within the UNMO, a Team A led by Mahathir and a Team B led by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah/Musa Hitam</li>
        <li>In 1986, Deputy PM Musa Hitam resigned, citing irreconcilable differences with Mahathir</li>
        <li>Mahthir's leadership was challenged as Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah tried to take his spot as UMNO president and thus as PM, but Mahathir narrowly won</li>
        <li>Mahathir oversaw attacks by the government on several NGOs critical of the government and a rise in race/religious/ethnic related tensions/issues</li>
        <li>There were a myriad of these issues but the main one was the Ministry of Education's decision to appoint over 100 senior assistants/supervisors to Chinese-medium primary schools, raising Chinese concern that the students might be forced to use English or Malay in school</li>
        <li>On 11 October 1987, over 2000 people demonstrated, led by the United Chinese School Committees Association of Malaysia, joined by leaders from the MCA, DAP, and GERAKAN, to protest the government's decision at 57 of the schools. </li>
        <li>On 17 October 1987, the UMNO Youth responded with their own 10,000 strong rally and UMNO politicians condemned MCA leaders</li>

        <li>The operation began with a mass arrest of ~100 people under the ISA including: DAP/MCA/PAS/UMNO/Gerakan opposition political leaders, social activists and other for incitement of racial sentiment and showing Marxist tendencies.</li>
        <li>The publication liscenses of The Star, Sin Chew Jit Poh, the Sunday Star, and Watan newspapers were also revoked, after being critical of Mahathir</li>
        <li>Mahathir also restricted free assembly and announced a nationwide ban on any gathering or large rally and in December 1987 introduced legislation to further restrict publishing and give more power to the police to prevent rallies</li>
        <li>Tunku Abdul Rahman quote about the operation and Mahathir's authoratarianism: "We are on the road to dictatorship. I cannot see any other way... This is no democracy."</li>

    <h3>Constitutional Crisis (1988)</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1988_Malaysian_constitutional_crisis -->
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1987_United_Malays_National_Organisation_leadership_election -->
        <!-- https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/Malaysia-from-independence-to-c-2000 -->
        <li>In 1987, the UMNO held elections for its numerous offices with PM Mahathir (Team A) being challenged by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah (Team B)</li>
        <li>However, Mahathir was the winner with 51% of the vote, Razaleigh's (48.5% of the vote) supporters called the election rigged and were further angered when Mahathir purged all Team B members from the Cabinet</li>
        <li>This was followed by 12 UMNO members filing a lawsuit with the High Court seeking a reelection.</li>
        <li>The UNMO formed a "Unity Panel" to try and reach a compromise but failed and Team B continued to seek a final judgement from the High Court</li>
        <li>This angered Mahathir, who had previously had spates with the court, and began making public heated attacks on the judged within the High Court</li>
        <li>Judge Harun, finally made a judgement and declared the UMNO "an unlawful society", thereby rendering "[w]hat happened in 1987" a nullity.</li>
        <li>Within the next two weeks, Mahathir announced the registration of the UMNO Baru (new UMNO), whose leadership was almost entirely composed of Team A.</li>
        <li>The Team B "UMNO 11" went on to appeal their case with the Supreme Court, looking to achieve new elections, but the case was rejected.</li>
        <li>Razaleigh would go on to split off and form the Semangat 46 (Spirit of 46) party and the UMNO Baru then dropped the "Baru" from their name, with both parties claiming to be the true successor to the UMNO.</li>
        <li>The UMNO 11 case was just one of many that angered Mahathir and following Operatin Lalang, he sumbitted several consitutional amendments to parliament</li>
        <li>These included divesting hte courts of hte "judicial power of the Federation" and giving them only such judicial powers as Parliament might grant them</li>
        <li>The Supreme Court and High Court judges responded by writing a secret letter to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the Malay rulers expressing their greviances and asked for help in stopping Mahathir's accusations of corruption</li>
        <li>In 1988, the Lord President of the Supreme Court, Tun Sallah Abas, and 5 other supreme court justices were suspended, effectively suspending the supreme court.</li>
        <li>Critics of Mahathir's actions, such as Tunku Abdul Rahman, called them "disgusting" while Mahathir supporters said he was liberating Malaysian judiciary from a colonial mindset and justified this with claims that the judges were abusing public funds for personel expenses such as luxury Italian furniture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Royal Immunity Ammendments (1993)</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_amendments_to_the_Constitution_of_Malaysia -->
        <li>Before 1993, the royalty could violate the law without persecution, unless they voluntarily wished to surrender their legal immunity</li>
        <li>In the 1990 general election, the Sultan of Kelantan, allegedly campaigned for Semangat 46 and PAS, resulting in the BN losing control of Kelantan to them.</li>
        <li>This outraged Mahathir, who said that the royal support for Semangat 46 violated the constitutionally required neutrality of royalty.</li>
        <li>In March 1992, the BN-led government and royalty relations further deteriorated when the government said the Kelantan Sultan owed $2.1 million ringgit after failing to pay taxes for the purchase of 20 Lamborghinis, the Sultan responded by calling for the implementation of Islamic laws in the PAS led state</li>
        <li>In July 1992, the son of Sultan Iskandar, the Sultan of Johor, assaulted a Perak hockey goalkeeper after Perak beat Johor in a championship.</li>
        <li>This upset Douglas Gomez, a hockey coach, who made public critisisms, which in turn made the Sultan angry</li>
        <li>In November 1992, the Sultan summoned Gomez to the Sultan palace, where Gomez was beaten by the Sultan, infront of his bodyguards.</li>
        <li>The Gomez incident was widely covered in Malaysian-state media and led to further widespread public outrage.</li>
        <li>In December 1992, parliment began proposing amendments to remove royal legal immunity but were not able to pass anything because the royalty needed to endorse the amendments, which they didn't</li>
        <li>The Dewan Rakyat and Dewan Negara were finally able to reach a compromise with the Agong that allowed the rulers to delay any legislation within 60 days (previous proposal was only 15 days)</li>
        <li>In March 1993, the amendments passed with the aim of removing legal immunity of the royalty</li>
        <li>Amendments to Articles 32, 38, 42, 63, 72 and 181 in the Constitution of Malaysia</li>
        <li>In May 1994, a further amendment was passed that allowed laws passed by both the Dewan Rakyat and the Dewan Negara to become law within 30 days, even without approval of the Agong.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Financial Crisis (1997-98)</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/Malaysia-in-the-21st-century -->
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis#Malaysia -->
        <li>In the early 1980s, Anwar Ibrahim gained rapid popularity in the BN</li>
        <li>Ibrahim was widely believed to be the successor to Mahathir</li>
        <li>In 1993, Anwar was elected as deputy president of the UMNO</li>
        <li>In 1997, the Asian financial criris occured, sparking from the financial collapse of the Thai baht</li>
        <li>The fallout quickly spread to Malaysia, the ringgit was heavily traded by speculators causing rating downgrades and a selloff of Malaysian stocks/currency.</li>
        <li>Malaysian credit dropped from investment grade to junk, the KLSE dropped from 1200 to 600, and hte ringgit dropped from 2.50/dollars to 4.57/dollars.</li>
        <li>Mahathir imposed strict capital controls (stopping overseas trade in riggit, restricing overseas investment abroad, restricting foreign portfolio funds) and announced a 3.80 peg to the US dollar</li>
        <li>Anwar was the finance minister in 1997 and differed in economic prescription opinion against Mahathir on how to rescue the economy</li>
        <li>By 1998, Malaysia had plunged into a recession with GDP dropping 6.2%, riggit dropping to 4.7/dollar, and KLSE dropping below 270 points. </li>
        <li>In September 1998, further capital controls were imposed and IMF aid was refused</li>
        <li>Also in September 1998, Mahathir removed Anwar from office, leading to Reformasi movement</li>
        <li>By 2005, Malaysia had returned to a $14 billion dollar surplus, however foreign investment and investor confidence has not returned to what it was pre-1997.</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Reformasi Movement (1998-2022)</h3>
    <ul>
        <!-- https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/Malaysia-in-the-21st-century -->
        <!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reformasi_(Malaysia) -->
        <li>During the 1997-98 financial crisis, Anwar (apparent heir to Mahathir) and Mahathir differed in opinion on how to save the economy, especially relating to IMF loans</li>
        <li>Mahathir wanted to stabilize the currency to cushion further speculation in the economy while Anwar advocated for IMF-style, free-market oriented corrective measures.</li>
        <li>The economy eventually began to recover under Mahathir's measures but Anwar continued to express opposition.</li>
        <li>This resulted in September 1998, in Mahathir removing Anwar from office and expelling him from the UMNO</li>
        <li>Following, Anwar began to lead public lectures against Mahathir, mostly among the youth who agreed with him on social justice and social safety nets for the economy.</li>
        <li>Opposition parties DAP and PAS also supported Anwar</li>
        <li>Still in September, 18 days after being removed from office, Mahathir finally arrested Anwar (and many of his supporters) and charged him with corruption and sexual misconduct (which he was eventually convicted of in 1999 when he was sentenced to 6 years in prison for corruption and later 9 years for sodomy)</li>
        <li>The conviction of Anwar has been widely discredited by the international community including the US, Amnesty International, and Indonesia and Anwar was seen photographed with a black eye while in custody</li>
        <li>In 2004, the Federal Courth overturned Anwar's sodomy convition and he was immediately released</li>
        <li>This (and to a lesser extent the factionalism within the UMNO/Semangat 46) led to protests, initiated by Anwar's arrest, under the banner of Reformasi, that were in support of Anwar and claimed the charges were only to huminiate him and to clear all potential rivals of Mahathir.</li>
        <li>The protester's demands where for Mahathir to step-down and the BN led government to end</li>
        
        <li>The protests broke out when Malaysia was hosting the Commonwealth Games and were untraditionally not racial based</li>

        <li>The demonstrations mostly tapered out by November 1998 but still continue for key dates such as Anwar's arrest day</li>
