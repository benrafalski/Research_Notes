    <h3>Islamic Movement</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Islam was introduced in the Malay Peninsula in 1100's CE and was the majority faith by the 1400-1500s with the rise of the Sultan</li>
        <li>Following WW2, the first Islamic political movements began to form with the Malay Nationalist Party (MNP) but was dissolved during the Malay Emergency</li>
        <li>In 1951, this movement would reform into the Pan Malayan Islamic Party (PAS) as a splinter group of the UMNO</li>
        <li>When Malaysia was formed, Sunni Islam was named the country's religion due to recommendations to do so from the Reid Commission, other religions remained legal constitutionally but freedom of religion is still limited (including a complete ban on Shia Islam)</li>
        <li>The constitution stated that you must be Muslim to be an ethnic Malay</li>
        <li>In 1972, the PAS president Asri Muda announced that the party would be joining the Alliance Party (UMNO-PAS partnership)</li>
        <li>PAS was most popular in the rural states such of Kelantan, Terengganu, Perlis, and Kedah</li>
        <li>In the 1974 general election, PAS got their most parliament seats (14) but Asri left BN (Alliance Party) in 1977, severely damaging PAS popularity (only 5 seats in 1978 election)</li>
        <li>In the late 1970s, the dakwah or Islamic fundumentalist revival grew among the younger generation who disliked the westernization of Malay society</li>
        <li>In 1977, during the Kelantan Emergency, the Islamic BERJASA political party was formed as a splinter group of the PAS </li>
        <li>In the 1978 election, BERJASA joined BN and won 11 state seats in Kelantan (UMNO got 23, PAS got 2) but their popularity quickly dissolved in subsequent elections</li>
        <li>Before the Islamic revival, many Malay Muslims only followed moderate Islam but after the revival, Malaysia transformed into a more Islamic enviornment</li>
        <li>Today, almost all ethnic Malays are Muslim and about 70% of Malay Muslim women wear headscarves (which popularized during the 1980s)</li>
