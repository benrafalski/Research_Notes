            <hr><h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> 
                China is the largest Asian country and covers most of Eastern Asia. 
                China has the second largest in the world, mostly ethnically homonogous (Han Chinese).
                There are 33 administrative units in China, under the direct control of the central government. 
                This includes 22 provinces, 5 autonomous regions, 4 minicipalities, and 2 special regions.
                China also claims Taiwan as a special province.
                Beijing is the capital of the People's Republic and is the cultural, economic, and communications center of China.
                Shanghai is the most industrial city and Hong Kong is the leading commercial center and port.
                China's terrain is both mountanous and lowlands and has the highest place on Earth.
                The climate ranges from dry deserts to tropical monsoons allowing for an eccentric variety of animals.
                China's recorded history is 4000 years old and has experienced relatively little outside influence.
                In 1949, a communist regime was established in China and the nation has evolved into a world superpower since then.
