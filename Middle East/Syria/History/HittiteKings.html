    <h2>Hittite Kings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Starting around 1600 BC the Hittite kings began to spread into northern
        Syria
      </li>
      <li>The took the cities of Alalakh, Aleppo, and Ebla</li>
      <li>Hatuslilis I was the earliest king to spread into northern Syria</li>
      <li>
        Hatuslilis eventually designated his grandson Marsilis I as king in 1620
        BC
      </li>
      <li>Marsilis would go on to take Aleppo and Mari</li>
      <li>He then ended the Amorite dynasty in the east in 1590 BC</li>
      <li>Marsilis would die later that year and be suceeded by Telipinus</li>
      <li>A power struggle then ensued and lawlessness ensued</li>
      <li>He made the Edict of Telipinus and designated the pankus</li>
      <li>
        The pankus was a general assembly that would be the high court for
        crimes
      </li>
      <li>The edict was generally successful and crimes mostly subsided.</li>
      <li>Later under Hattusilus III between 1275-1250 BC, the Hittites and Egyptians signed a defense pact and peace treaty</li>
      <li>In 1193 BC however, the Hittite empire fell suddenly</li>
    </ul>
