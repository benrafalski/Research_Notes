    <h2>Il-Khans</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hulegu Khan, Genghis Khan's grandson, led the second Mongol invasion of Iran.</li>
        <li>Since Genghis took Iran in 1231 there had been small dynasties fighting for power in the area</li>
        <li>In 1256, Hulegu had captured all of Iran up to Baghdad and established the Il-Khanid dynasty</li>
        <li>Halegu established his capital in Azerbaijan and set out to expand to the Mediterranean but was prevented by Egypt</li>
        <li>After Hulegu took over, the Abbasid caliph was disbanded, sharia law was ended, and he established Mongol tribal law over Iran.</li>
        <li>However, in 1295, when Mahmud Ghazan came to power and converted Iran back from Buddhism to Islam.</li>
        <li>Ghazan's Islam was designed to appeal to both Sunni and Shi'i.</li>
        <li>Eventually, infighting between Ghazan's military leaders led to the breakdown of the Il-Khans dynasty in 1335.</li>
        <li>The Jalayirids took Azerbaijan in 1336 and the Muzaffarids took Yazd and Fars</li>
    </ul>
