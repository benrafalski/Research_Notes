        <li>Sheikh was Iran's highest ranking cleric during this time</li>
        <li>He was hanged in July after the Majles came back to power and found him guilty of plotting to overthrow them.</li>
        <li>This showed that not all religious elites were in favor of the reforms.</li>
    </ul>
