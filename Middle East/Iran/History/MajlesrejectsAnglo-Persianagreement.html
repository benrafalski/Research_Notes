    <h2>Majles rejects Anglo-Persian agreement</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The British soon made an offer in August 1919, to give Iran military and financial support, effectively making them a British protectorate.</li>
        <li>After much internal debate, the Majles refused.</li>
        <li>The British were reluctant to withdraw after this but eventually did in 1921 due to international pressure.</li>
    </ul>
