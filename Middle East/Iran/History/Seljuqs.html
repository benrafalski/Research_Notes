    <h2>Seljuqs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In the early 1030's Mahmud permitted the Oguz Turks tribesmen to use Ghaznavid land for grazing grounds</li>
        <li>Between 1038 and 1040 these tribesmen were united under the Seljuq family and drove the Ghaznavids out of Iran in the Battle of Dandanqan.</li>
        <li>In 1055 Toghril Beg, the Seljuq sultan, invaded Baghdad, ended Buyid rule</li>
        <li>This established Sunni Seljuq control over the Abbasid caliph along with the Seljuq dynasty</li>
        <li>The Seljuq regime aimed to restore an orthodox Sunni Muslim political structure in Baghdad and suppress the Shiâ€™i Fatimid caliph who had gained power in northern Africa.</li>
        <li>Over the next few decades, various Seljuq sultans would expand their territory and control all of Iran, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine.</li>
        <li>The Seljuq empire collapsed in 1153 after Turkmen tribes united under Atsiz captured the sultan because they did not want to pay taxes</li>
    </ul>
