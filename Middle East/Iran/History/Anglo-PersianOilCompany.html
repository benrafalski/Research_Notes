    <h2>Anglo-Persian Oil Company</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In May 1908, D'Arcy found his first strike of oil in the Middle East.</li>
        <li>In April, this led to the formation of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to take over the oil-field concession.</li>
        <li>This first strike sparked a new gold rush to the Middle East for geopolitical oil interests.</li>
        <li>By 1914, the British government would become the primary shareholder in the company.</li>
    </ul>
