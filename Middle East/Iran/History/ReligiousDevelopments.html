    <h2>Religious Developments</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Under the Safavids the Shi'i clergy began to interfere with politics.</li>
        <li>The ulama actively discouraged religions like Sufism and began to enforce Shi'ism among the masses.</li>
        <li>During Safavid rule Iranian Shi’ism began to see a shift where Islamic legal conclusions rested with a group of qualified scholars called the mujtahid, rather than being interpreted from the legal writings of the 12 imams as it was before.</li>
        <li>Once the Safavids collapsed, the role of Shi’i clergymen in political affairs only increased.</li>
    </ul>
