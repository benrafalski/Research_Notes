    <h2>Timurids</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Muzaffarids controlled Iran until Timur began his conquests.</li>
        <li>Between 1380-1405 Timur (Tamerlane), a descendant of Genghis Khan, entered Iran</li>
        <li>He conquered the Jalayirids, beat the Ottomans, and took over Syria.</li>
        <li>Timur was extremely brutal in his conquest and he eventually died of illness while traveling to China.</li>
        <li>After Timur died, his dynasty was divided among his two sons.</li>
        <li>Between 1406-17, one of the sons, Shah Rokh, extended his territory over most of Iran</li>
        <li>The Timurid dynasty continued as Mulsims and followed Sunni Islam.</li>
        <li>After Shah Rokh died Abu Saâ€™id took over and was quickly overthrown by the Ak Koyunlu Uzbek Turkmen.</li>
    </ul>
