    <h2>Fath Ali Shah</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fath Ali's reign saw the start of strengthening diplomatic relations with the West and European rivalries over Iran.</li>
        <li>He was defeated by Russia in two wars between 1804-1828</li>
        <li>This lost him losing Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan in the treaties of Golestan in 1813 and Turkmenchay in 1828</li>
        <li>These treaties started a rivalry between imperial Britain and Russia over Iran.</li>
        <li>In 1834 Fath Ali died and was replaced by his grandson Mohammand, who fell under Russian influence.</li>
        <li>In 1848, Mohammad died and was replaced by his son Naser od-Din</li>
    </ul>
