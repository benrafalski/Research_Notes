        <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>Iran is a desert-mountainous country in southwest Asia. Their history dates back to the Achaemenid dynasty in 500 BE. Today, they have a theocratic Islamic regime marked by economic unrest. The capital of Iran is Tehran. Iran was previously known as Persia, which had a history of imperialism in the region. They have a strategic position with many natural resources, including petroleum. In the early 16th century Shi’i Islam began to grow in Iran. In 1925 the Pahlavi line ascended and attempted to modernize Iran but failed, leading to their overthrow in 1979 during the Iranian Revolution, which turned Iran into a Shi’i theocratic state. This left Iran in conflict with Iraq and in support of terrorism, which made them an international pariah. In the 1990s social unrest began to grow in opposition to the theocratic rule but was crushed in the early 2000’s by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. <sup>[1]</sup></p>

                        <li><u>Twelver Shiʿi Muslim:</u> Over 99% of the country is Muslim, of these 95% are Twelver Shiʿi Muslims. Twelver Shiʿi is the official state religion and has been since 1501. Twelver Shi'a is currently the world’s largest Shi’i group, with 40% of the Shi’i population residing in Iran. The Twelver clergy has been the main political force in Iran since 1979. The priests in Twelver are a community of scholars called ulama. To become part of the ulama you must be a male Muslim who attended an Islamic college. Lower clergy members are called mullahs and staff a majority of local religious sites. Authorities in Islamic law are called mujtahids and the single most honored mujtahid becomes ayatollah and is called marja. There is no religious hierarchy so believers can only avoid sin by following the teaching of their chosen marja. This has given more power to the ulama in recent years. <sup>[28,29]</sup></li>
                        <li><u>Sunni Muslim:</u> About 7% of the population is Sunni. Mostly made up of Kurds and Turkmen. <sup>[28]</sup></li>

Under the Abbasids the jizya tax was created and forced many Zoroastrians to convert, the British finally forced the Qajar dynasty to eliminate the jizya and under the Pahlavi dynasty Zoroastrians were treated better but this was all reverted after the revolution. Ever since the 1979 revolution the minorities have not been treated equally even though they are recognized in the Iranian constitution. The Bahāʾi Faith has especially been persecuted by the Muslim clergy and Iranian government, especially after the revolution when 300,000 of them were persecuted by the government. Baha’i religion originated in Shiraz. <sup>[28,30,31,32]</sup></li>

                        <li><u>International isolation:</u> Due to Iran’s xenophobia from its conservative politicians and sanctions from the US and others they have been isolated on international markets, hampering their economic growth and restricted foreign investment. In 1996, the US expanded sanctions on a petroleum embargo, technology exports, and a variety of Iranian imports. <sup>[35]</sup></li>
                        <li><u>Economic goals:</u> Since 1979, Iran has aimed to become economically independent, full of unemployment, and a high standard of living. <sup>[35]</sup></li>
                        <li><u>Economic challenges:</u> Rapidly increasing population, which has increasingly become younger. Failure of agriculture production, forcing migration into Iran’s largest cities. High unemployment and inflation. Reliance on petroleum exports. <sup>[35]</sup></li>
                        <li><u>State planning:</u> Public sector includes major industries, banks, insurance, utilities, communication, foreign trade, and transportation. Production and distribution of goods and services are run using cooperatives. The private sector fills in the rest. Initially after 1979, the leftists and conservatives in government debated the expansion of privatization in the economy. The Iran-Iraq war prompted state intervention and the government gained a monopoly on all income-producing activities after they nationalized all banks and insurance companies. <sup>[35]</sup></li>

                        <li><u>Agriculture:</u> One-third of Iran’s land is farmland but only one-tenth is under cultivation because of soil and water issues, mostly in the west and northwest. One-third of the cultivated land is irrigated, the rest is dry farmed. Agriculture accounts for about one-fifth of Iran’s GDP and jobs. Most farms are small and not economically viable, which is why there has been mass migration to cities. This has led to low crop yield and poverty in rural areas. After 1979, many farmers claimed their land privately. In the 1990s, large government infusions improved farming production marginally. Iran farms cereals, fruits, vegetables, cotton, sugar, nuts, olives, spices, tea, tobacco, and herbs. Almost all Saffron also comes from Iran. <sup>[36,37]</sup></li>

Only one was finished with the help of Russia in 2011. In 2002, it was discovered Iran had uranium enrichment facilities and many feared they were trying to make nuclear weapons. Iran says they only want it for peaceful purposes but they have been punished with sanctions since 2006. <sup>[38]</sup></li>

Since Shi’i are a minority in Islam they have faced persecution and have seen themselves as martyrs attempting to return al-Husayn to power. Each year on the anniversary of al-Husayn’s death the Shi’i mourn on the holiday of Ashura. During Ashura, Shi’i believers perform rituals of self-beatings with their bare-hands or with chains and blades sometimes.

Neyshabur, Esfahan, and Shiraz also have lots of Islamic mosques, madrasahs (muslim schools), shrines, and palaces. Western architecture techniques began to trend under the monarchy but in 1967 the National Council for Iranian Architecture was formed and discouraged western styles in favor of Iranian styles.

However, publication of classical works is restricted by the Islamic clergy. Iranian literature was influenced by the west in the 19/20th centuries and served as a form of protest with authors such as Sadeq Hedayat, Jalal Al-e Ahmad, Sadeq-e Chubak, Ahmad Shamlu, and Forough Forrokhazad. After the revolution, many authors went into exile and began to publish abroad. After the revolution a feminist movement also formed with writers such as Shahrnoush Parsipour and Moniru Ravanipur. <sup>[78]</sup></li>
                        <li><u>Cinema:</u> Movies are the most popular form of entertainment in Iran. After the revolution films were banned but then the government began subsidizing them if they promoted Islam but they were not very popular. Later, films about the Iran-Iraq war gained popularity. In the 1990s the public wanted better relations with the west and government moderation and this is when the Iranian film industry became one of the most prestigious in the world, winning numerous international awards. Directors include: Bahram Bayzaʾi, Abbas Kiarostami, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, Dariyush Mehrjuʾi, Jafar Panahi, and Asghar Farhadi. Women films also gained traction with directors such as Rakhshan Bani Etemad and Tahmineh Milani. <sup>[78,83,84,85]</sup></li>
