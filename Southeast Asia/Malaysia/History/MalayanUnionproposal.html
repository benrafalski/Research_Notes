    <h2>Malayan Union proposal</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In April 1946, the Malayan Union was proposed by the British to replace British Malaya</li>
        <li>The proposal was approved by the Malay rulers, however reluctant to cede their power to the British</li>
        <li>The Malayan Union was a single state that would hold all the Malayan territories (all of peninsular Malaysia) except Singapore</li>
        <li>The Union would afford equal rights and citizenship to all ethnicities, including non-Malays, and be administered by a British government</li>
        <li>This resulted in an upsurge of Malay nationalism and outrage in opposition to the plan</li>
        <li>Eventually, a Malay politician Dato Onn bin Jaafar formed the UMNO against the Malayan Union</li>
        <li>Malays also wore white headbands to symbolize their opposition</li>
        <li>After years of strikes, demonstrations, and boycotts, the Malayan Union was dissolved and resplaced by the Federation of Malaya</li>
    </ul>
