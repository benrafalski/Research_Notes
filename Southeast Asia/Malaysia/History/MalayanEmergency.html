    <h2>Malayan Emergency</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The Malayan emergency was a period of unrest following the creation of the Federation of Malaya</li>
        <li>In 1930, the Malayan Communinst Party was formed</li>
        <li>They were mostly Chinese and wanted an independent communist Malaya</li>
        <li>After the federation was formed, in April, they went into the jungles and began a guerrilla insurgency against the colonial government</li>
        <li>In June 1948, the government declared a state of emergency after 3 European planters were murdered by communists in Perak</li>
        <li>The majority of the Chinese did not back the communists</li>
        <li>The British responed with military suppression and forcibly moved many rural Chinese into strategically controlled "New Villages" to cut off food for the guerrillas</li>
        <li>This isolated villagers from guerrillas but resulted in increased government unpopularity</li>
        <li>Under High commissioner Sir Gerald Templer, the British finally started to ease some of the social/political tensions</li>
        <li>Templer implemented local elections and the creation of village councils, facilitating independence</li>
        <li>He also gave many Chinese citizenship</li>
        <li>These measures decreased the support for the insurgency in the mid-1950s</li>
        <li>By July 1960, the emergency was officially declared over</li>

    </ul>
