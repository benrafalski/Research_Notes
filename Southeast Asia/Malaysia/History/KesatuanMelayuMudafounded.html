    <h2>Kesatuan Melayu Muda founded</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Formed in 1938 in Kuala Lumpur, by a group of leftist Malay intelligentsia educated in Sultan Idris Training College</li>
        <li>Was the first nationalist movement in Malaysia at a time when nationalism began to rise</li>
        <li>Nationalism began to rise due to Malaysia becoming more educated and the Chinese/Indians not integrating with them</li>
        <li>They had a notable willingness to use violence to meet their ends</li>
        <li>The KMM was always radical and never gained more than 60 members support</li>
        <li>The KMM believed in radical anti-colonialism that had spread from Indonesia</li>
        <li>They led several Malay Congresses from 1939-1941 until the Japanese occupation</li>
        <li>After the Japanese invaded, they ended up fighting alongside them thinking they would help give them independence. </li>
        <li>However, the Japanese rejected the KMM request for an independent state</li>
    </ul>
