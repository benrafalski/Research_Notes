    <h2>British colonial expansion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Brits were initially adverse to the Saimese</li>
        <li>Sweetenham convinced them to take control of the states by painting the native rulers as bad and warning against rival European intervention.</li>
        <li>In 1909, the Brits gained control over northern Malay from the Saim (Thai)</li>
        <li>Added Kedah, Terengganu, Kelantan, and Perlis to their colonial rule</li>
        <li>None of them became part of the Malay federation yet though</li>
    </ul>
