    <h2>Liu Shan Bang Revolt</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In February 1857, Liu Shan Bang led 600 Chinese rebels to revolt on James Brooke</li>
        <li>Brooke fled accross the Kuching River while the rebels burnt his house down</li>
        <li>The rebels mistook a 17-year old boy as Brooke and beheaded him then put his head on a pole</li>
        <li>However, the rebels only controlled Kuching for a day.</li>
        <li>Brooke and his nephew Charles Brooke led a force of Bidayuh and Iban soldiers and crushed the rebels.</li>
        <li>Charle's Iban forces slaughtered 3,000 villagers in the process.</li>
