    <h2>Opium in the Strats Settlements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>After 1867, opium began produce a signaificant amount of revenue for the Straits Settlements</li>
        <li>Opium was imported from India in bulk to be sold to the Governemnt of China</li>
        <li>The Chinese merchants in Malaya would then be able to sell it</li>
        <li>The Chinese merchants were often wealthy Chinese who had enough money to outbid everyone else trying to buy and sell opium</li>
        <li>This supplied the British government with almost half of their revenue, by 1904 it was 59% of revenue</li>
        <li>The government also sanctioned alchohol during this time as well.</li>
