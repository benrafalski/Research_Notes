    <h2>Mat Salleh Rebellion</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Muslim chief Mat Salleh fought the British North Borneo Company from 1895-1900</li>
        <li>In August 1895, Mat Salleh lead a group to Sandakan to petition taxes</li>
        <li>The British representitives would not hear them though and later accused him of distrubing the peace</li>
        <li>The BNBC went to Salleh's home to arrest him but he escaped and became a wanted man (they also thought he killed two Ibans in 1894)</li>
        <li>This triggered a war between Salleh and the BNBC</li>
        <li>In July 1897, Mat Salleh led a group to the BNBC settlement in Gaya and raided and torched it</li>
        <li>Cowie and the BNBC went to the Brunei sultan for help and he gave them more land to administer</li>
        <li>Salleh began establishing different forts accross North Borneo and the two sides traded attacks on each other over the rest of the year</li>
        <li>In April 1898, Cowie chartered the Palatan Peace Pact that released Salleh's men from prison and allowed him to stay at his fort in Tambunan in exchange for an end to fighting. </li>
        <li>Salleh continued fighting the Taiwanese, who asked the BNBC for help, who gave them help in an attempt to take Tambunan from Salleh</li>
        <li>Salleh saw this as a breach of the pact and prepared to resume fighting, refusing negotiations. </li>
        <li>In January 1900, the BNBC attacked Salleh in his fort in Tambunan and killed Salleh after the fort fell</li>
        <li>It took until 1905 before Sallehs men fully surrendered</li>
    </ul>
