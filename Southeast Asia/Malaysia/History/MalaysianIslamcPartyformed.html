    <h2>Malaysian Islamc Party formed</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>As Malay nationalism began to rise, the Islamic Malaysians were represented by Kaum Muda</li>
        <li>In Match 1947, the Supreme Religious Council of Malaysia (MATA) was fomed at a Pan-Malayan Islamic confrence organized by the PKMM</li>
        <li>By March 1948, the first Islamic political party in the fight for independence was formed called Hizbul Muslimin</li>
        <li>Hizbul Muslimin's main goal was an independent Malaysian Islamic State</li>
        <li>However, Hizbul Muslimin was dissolved later that year during the Malayan Emergency after the British banned them for allegedly having relations with the Communist Party of Malaya</li>
        <li>By 1951, the UMNO had a growing desire to form a separate Islamic political organization</li>
        <li>This led to the formation of the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS)</li>
        <li>Many PAS members were also dual UMNO members as well</li>
