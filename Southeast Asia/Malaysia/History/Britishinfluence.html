    <h2>British influence</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1870s, the British wanted the minerals in Malaysia</li>
        <li>So they intervened in the affairs of the sultanates since they were afraid of political unrest</li>
        <li>The first British adviser in Perak was murdered by the outraged Malays there</li>
    </ul>
